brain mri : 

      There are two left temporal lesions, their close proximity 

to the CSF and 

associated diffusion

      restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic oedema raise 

the possibility 

of CNS lymphoma in

      addition to brain parenchymal metastases.

      There is no leptomeningeal metastasis.

 

brain mri :

Interval enlargement in previously seen to adjacent lesions in 

posterior left 

temporal lobe, with mild increase in surrounding oedema. The 

appearance is most 

suggestive of metastatic process versus multifocal 

glioma/glioblastoma. Please 

correlate with histopathology. Is there any contraindication for

however, the perilesional vasogenic oedema appear increased. No midline shift 

or 

life-threatening herniation. Grossly unchanged 

calcified meningioma based along the clivus, encasing the basilar artery as 

before and indenting the anterior aspect of the 

craniocervical junction. The brain vasculature appears patent without gross 

filling defect to suggest thrombosis. No acute intracranial 

haemorrhage or established major territorial infarction. Diffuse parenchymal 

atrophic changes with dilated ventricular system and other 

CSF spaces as before. No active hydrocephalus. Resolved previously seen 

mucosal 

thickening of sphenoid sinus and right posterior

-Admitted for pain crisis on 1/1

 

********** was admitted on 1/1

He presented to the ER with generalized pain - mostly lower limbs (pain crisis) 

He was already on:

MIR 10mg, MST 60mg,  fentaNYL PATCH  25 mcg/hr at home

 

In the ER, he was given perfelgan, and morphine 5mg IV twice 

Pain was still not controlled. 

 

Vitals taken in the ER showed decrease O2 saturation 80%, pulse reaching 150's

He was put on face mask 6L, chest x ray was requested - showed perihilar 

infiltrates. 

 

Labs on admission showed: 

CBC - hemoglobin 10.8, platelets 317, reticulocytes 8.1%

Hemolytic workeup done - haptoglobin <10, LDH 2002, total bilirubin/direct 

bilirubin = 1.58/0.72, coombs test ( direct and indirect ) positive, 

monospecific coombs test +4 IgG.

 

Admitted for pain management.

 

He spiked a fever on the same day of admission 39.1 c 

Septic workeup was done and repeated

CBC - hemoglobin 9.8, reticulocytes 9%, total bilirubin/direct bilirubin 

1.54/0.54

He stayed tachypnic ( while on face mask 6L, so he was put on vapotherm, on 

auscultation he had decreased basilar bilateral airway entry )

 

ICU were consulted:

Dr.**********n was informed about his condition 

Plan: - Manage pain 

      - Start supportive vapotherm --> he was started on vapotherm FiO2 40, Flow

 

        rate 20 

 

Dr.**********an **********taab was informed about his generalized pain condition 

pain team plan : - start ketamine 0.1mg/kg/hr

                 - increase fentanyl by PCA to 175/175 - gradually increased

                 - make paracetramol regualar 

                 - give hydrocortison stress dose 

                 - re-assess after changes & inform dr.**********an 

 

He was started on meropenem, vancomycin, zomax, tamiflu as a case of chest 

infection

 

-Respiratory:

Patient was on vapotherm FiO2 40, Flow rate 20 on 1/1

Today, on 3/1, his respiratory status was improved, so he was weaned to face 

mask 10L after assesement by the respiratory team , his o2 saturation on face 

mask 10L was 99%

 

-Infectious wise:

Today, he was afebrile day 2 

On meropenem, vancomycin, zomax, tamiflu day 3

 

-Pain wise:

Generalized Pain was improved and controlled on:

-FCI 175/175mcg via PCA

-ketamine 0.1mg/kg/hr.

-ibuprofen 160MG*3.

-gaba 300MG*2.

-paracetamol prn 

 

Pain team assesement today -> 

The patient's bony pain is controlled ,he moves his lower limbs with mild pain .

 

-Hematology wise:

Hemoglobin stable on 8.2 since 2 days 

Reticulocytes trending down from 12 to 9.4

Total/direct bilirubin 1.1/0.4

 

**During morning round today, patient was seen, he was interactive, pain was 

controlled - he reported decreased pain , respiratory status - on face mask 10L,

 

O2 saturation normal.

Respiratory auscultation - same findings as yesterday - decreased bilateral 

airway entry basilary. 

Pain team also assesed him - patient's bony pain is controlled ,he moves his 

lower limbs with mild pain. 

 

He was planned to be given IVIG for 2 days 

And to start on clexane prophylaxis BID 

 

TODAYS EVENT :

==============

I was called by the nurse due to decreased o2 saturation 50% upon examination

Father was not present at the time. 

Patient was already on face mask 10L 

Patient was unresponsive, gasping, weak pulses.

Later on there was neither response on the epinephrine doses nor on epinephrine 

infusion.

He recieved two doses of bicarbonate and a dose of calcium gluconate 

with no response. 

Glucocheck twice were above 100 mg/dl and was given 500ml Normal saline IV 

bolus. 

Pupils were initially fixed mid-dilated then later became fixed full dilated.

 

Total of 15 cycles of CPR were done with asystole in all cycles.

The patient developed a recurrence of fever during admission. The last fever was

 

recorded on July 1, 2024, at 6 AM, with a temperature of 38.7°C. She complains 

of persistent dry cough, sweating, and fever. Blood workup, including testing 

for brucella, respiratory panel, and COVID, was negative. A CT scan of the chest

 

revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary, pleural, and hepatic metastases, as well 

as enlarged bilateral internal mammary, bilateral hilar, mediastinal, and 

retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The patient was treated with Tazocin from June 28, 

2024, until July 1, 2024. MRI 7/1/2024 for brain showed no acute insults 

(patient complained of perioral numbness). Further testing for blood film, 

interferon gamma for TB, HIV, and urine cultures are pending. Blood cultures 

showed no growth including those from 30/1/2024. Patient will be discharged on 

home medications.

BIOPSY REVIEW: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. 

-KRAS showed mutated version.

-MMR protiens showed intact staining pattern--low MSI tumor.

 

CAP CT: 

-There is circumferential wall thickening of the cecal measuring up to 2.1 cm in

 

thickness of about 7 cm long , + luminal narrowing , there is surrounding 

desmoplastic reaction and few surrounding lymph nodes measuring up to 0.6 cm in 

short axis. 

-The liver is homogeneously enhanced with with a small hypoattenuating lesion 

noted at segment V of the liver measuring around 1.1 cm which show peripheral 

enhancement on arterial phase and filling on delayed images, probably 

benign/haemangioma however liver MRI is better for characterisation to rule out 

metastasis. 

-Another tiny hypoattenuating lesion noted at segment VIII of the liver, too 

small to characterise 

 

CT CHEST:

Solitary pulmonary nodule in the apico-posterior segment of left upper lobe 

measuring 0.7 cm , for attention on follow-up to exclude metastasis. 

 

ABDOMEN MRI:

There are a three tiny (less than 4 mm) hepatic nodules, most pronounced on DWI 

B value 100 (series 601 images 296, 308 and 

188). The lesions are poorly enhancing on arterial and venous phases and appears

 

isointense to adjacent parenchyma on delayed 

images. However, that retention of of contrast on hepatobiliary phase

 

PET/CT 16-3-2024

-left upper lobe pulmonary nodule showing mild increased FDG uptake, measuring 

about 0.9 cm with SUVmax 2.6. 

-circumferental wall thickening within the cecum showing increased FDG uptake 

with SUVmax 24.7. 

-several small perilesional lymph nodes showing mild FDG uptake, the most 

prominent meausring about 0.7 cm with SUVmax 1.7. 

-There are at least two hypodense liver lesions within segments V &VIII and 

showing mild FDG uptake, the most prominent in the segment VIII measuring about 

0.8 cm with SUVmax 3.7. 

-Hypermetabolic left upper lobe pulmonary nodule as well as few liver lesions/ 

segments V & VIII as described above, suspicious for metastases.

 

THORACIC:

S/P FOLFOX*4  23/5/2024

 

CAP CT 29/5/2024: 

-Stable solitary well-defined nodule in the medial aspect of the left upper lobe

 

measuring of 0.7 cm. 

-Interval more or less stable appearance of inhomogeneous mass lesion and marked

 

irregular wall thickening affecting the caecum and 

ascending colon measuring at least 8 cm in length. 

The condition is associated with surrounding pericolonic small lymph nodes. 

-The liver is still showing tiny hypodense lesions affecting segment V and VIII 

, otherwise no evidence of definite recent focal hepatic 

lesion or biliary dilatation. 

 

 

Thoracic surgery review: 

The lesion is resectable in it's current state

and could be managed by SBRT if surgically unfit or the patient elected not to 

do surgery

 

Presented for counseling regarding surgery 

 

The images were reviewed with Dr. ********** **********a. One of the lesions is close to

 

the right portal vein which makes ablative technique risky for possible vascualr

 

injuries. We discussed the surgery (Open right hemicoelctomy + open right 

hepatectomy). The surgery and it's risks and complications were explained. 

 

SBRT to the left pulmonary nodules to commence after surgery. 

 

Plan: 

-Review the images again with Dr. **********hali********** **********a and Dr. ********** **********l

-Booked for surgery right hemicolectomy + Right hepatectomy 

 

The images were reviewed with Dr. ********** **********ha 

 

The deep lesion is amenable for ablatino using IRE which would spare the patient

 

a major surgery (Right hepatectomy). Addionally, the lung lesion was reviewed 

with Dr. ********** **********l, and we agreed for SBRT rather than VATS 

 

The patinet was sen in the clini today by Dr. ********** **********, the plan was 

discussed and she agreed to proceed with surgery.

Important development during hospitalization

presented to ED complaining dizziness imblance and falling down today on his 

lower back. 

 

active issues 

=============

1. dizziness and FD > hemorrahgic brain mets

- Brain CT 27/6/24

 Limited evaluation of the known brain metastases. - There is 

enlarging two metastatic 

lesions at left frontal and parietal lobes , the later one appears haemorrhagic.

 

There is new surrounding mild 

vasogenic oedema. - There is no midline shift or life-threatening herniation

 

- started on dexa 4*4 D1 27/6/24

 

-BRAIN MRI :

Increasing size and number of multiple supra and infratentorial metastases 

measuring upto 1.3 cm, some of 

which are associated with vasogenic oedema

 

- radiation oncology team consulted,pending their plan .

 

- neurosurgery team consulted, observation with Brain CT after 48H. from 

neurosurgery point of view we preferred to hold antiplatlets 

 

- neurology team consulted 

 

- discussed with his primary cardiologist by  Dr ********** **********bu **********jleh,since his last

 

coronary stent was on jan/2024 keep on aspirin and hold plavix.

 

- follow up, pain much better and even the gait and mobility

 

- follow Brain CT 29/6/24 48H, seen bu neurosurgery. hemorrahgic component 

sliglty increased. keep observation and holding plavix 

 

- pelvis xray no fracture

- pain killer as needed 

- SPine MRI done by ED for LL weakness and urinary incontinnece. NO CORD 

COMPRESSION 

- spine MRI There is slightly increased anterior wedging and height reduction at

 

L1 vertebral body (now mild to moderate compared to mild previously). - There is

 

partially included enlarging adrenal metastases. - 

There is partially included moderate to severe right pleural effusion.

- now  no urinary incontinence 

 

PLAN:

follow radiotherapy plan

DC on dexa 4 mg bid as 1 r onc order

 

2. Hypotension :

- BP 90/50 mmmgh 

- improved  with IV fluid > 100/70 M**********H 

- family report poor oral intake 

- K 4.3 NA 136

- cortisol am  2.05. started before on dexa for perilesional brain edema 

- septic WU sent >>till now no foci 

 

- plan : 

given tazoicn D1 28/6/24. switched to meropenem D1 29/6/24 due to 

elevated LFT >> will be DC ON AMOCLAN as pt is not neutropenic and no fever , VS

 

stable and no source detected .

it is difficult to know if patient has adrenal isufficiency , endocrine team 

contacted for low cortisol (as it may be caused by malnutrition ) and pt will be

 

kept on steroids for brain edema/radiotherapy refer back to endocrine clinic 

once off steroids for assesment and for ACTH stimulation test .

 

3. dysphagia :IMPROVED 

- for solid mainly for longtime 

- speech and swallow consulted : regular diet

Tried sips of water, which the patient tolerated very well, no sign of chocking.

According to her daughter, the patient can tolerate soft diet and water intake 

smoothly.

Impression: 

normal swallowing 

plan: 

REGULAR DIET 

 

4. bigeminy:

- upon checking patinet, no new symptoms

- presented to ED with dizziness 

- on exam, BP 90/50 mmgh 

- ECG bigeminy with Hr 80/min 

- cardiology team , start cordarone 400 mg then 200 

mg BID <<<has a hx of lung fibrosis contacted cardiology oncall DC CORDARONE 

,keep on beta blocker can increase dose of b blocker if needed to control HR.

 

 

5. transaminits: 

- heptacelluar pattern 

- elevated since jun/2024

- medications adjusted , tazocin switched to meropenem 

- FU abdomen CT scan : 

 

-IMP: MEDICATION IDNCUED 

-fu CHEM20 ON 3/7 AS OUTPT TO FOLLOW LIVER ENZYMES 

-PT IS EAGER TO BE DISCHARGED AND LIVES IN ********** NEAR THE HOSPITAL .

 

6. Pleural effusion :

- right moderate to severe 

- SP PIGTAIL INSERTED right lung (output 3500 total) 

-analysis : exudative 

-pending cytology/culture 

 

7.follow CT CAP for assessment of cancer response to ipi/nivo

 

 

-1r oncology on board note :

I saw the patient on Friday. He was admitted with dizziness and hypotension. 

Brain imaging shows worsening of the brain metastasis with some hemorrhage in 

lesions.

- DC plavix but continue aspirin. I contacted the patient's primary cardiologist

 

Dr Ashraf ********** **********ubbaj about this and he agrees. 

- Agree with dexa for brain edema. 

- Consult with rad onc for brain radiation as the brain lesions increased in 

size while on immunotherapy. He needs to start radiation quickly. 

- CT CAP for assessment of cancer response to ipi/nivo. 

- Agree wiht the hypotension management. This might be a sign of adrenal insuff.

 

He is currently on dexa for the brain mets. I will be difficult to assess the 

adrenal status while on dexam. Infection is another possibility. Agree with the 

inpatient team management.

Impression:

 

      Interval improvement of the previously noted diffuse urinary bladder 

wall 

thickening and perivesical fat stranding, however there are multifocal nodular 

urinary bladder wall thickening measuring up to 0.7 cm.

      Focal nodular thickening at the left vesical ureteric junction 

associated 

with mild nodular urothelial thickening at the left ureteric insertion with no 

definite filling defect.

      There is no suspicious filling defect in the opacified upper renal tract 

on delayed images.

      There is no visceral metastasis or lymphadenopathy.

********** female, known HPV related endocervical adenocarcinoma locally invasive with 

LN mets, post CCRT/cisplatin MAR 2023 with adjuvant brachytherapy completed JUNE

 

2023. AUG 2023 with progressive pelvic LAP complicated with obstructive 

nephropathy for which she underwent Bilateral DJ placement then bilateral 

nephrostomies + pulmonary mets, was planned to be started on palliative chemo 

gemzar which was delayed for months due to renal + femoral venous thrombosis for

 

which she underwent thrombectomy SEP 2023, started on NOV 2023 two cycles with 

further DP and new liver mets + local progression. Recent hx of C.diff colitis 

31st DEC 2023. Planned for best supportive care.

 

She has recent admission for bleeding from nephrostomies and was discharged on 

15/1.

 

Patient is regularly followed by home care. She complained of SOB and and O2 sat

 

was done and was found to be 70% and so she was told to come to ER. She has been

 

complaining of SOB for one week duration (since discharge) along with 

progressively increasing pleuritic chest pain and cough productive of bloody 

sputum, palpitations, and orthopnea with fatigue and general weakness but no 

fever or chills. She has also been complaining of red urine from right 

nephrostomy and foul smelling green vaginal discharge. Review of systems is 

otherwise negative 

 

Significant laboratory findings 

- VBG: pH 7.41, HCO3 25.3, CO2 40, lactate 1.0

- PCT 0.79, WBC 25.8 (neutrophilic predominance)

- INR 3.56, PTT 61.6, Fibrinogen 655

- D-Dimer 3.33

- Platelets 382

- Cr 0.9 > 1.1 > 1.2 > 1.6

 

Significant Radiology findings 

CT Abdomen/Chest verbal report:

- There's new moderate right pleural effusion, mild pleural effusion on the left

Important development during hospitalization

1) Pneumonia

- Patient has chronic cough. Presented with increased cough and sputum with SOB

- Sputum was described as bloody

- Hypoxia at home, O2 sat ~70%, tachycardic

- General weakness and fatigue, no fever or chills

- Afebrile, normotensive

- CXR: Diffuse bilateral infiltrates with pleural effusion

- VBG: pH 7.41, HCO3 25.3, CO2 40, lactate 1.0

- PCT 0.79, WBC 25.8 (neutrophilic predominance)

- Patient has significant thrombotic history, however she presented with frank 

  bleeding from nephrostomies and has sifnificantly elevated INR so possible

  PE can't be treated.

- Antibiotic history:

  . Tavanic 25-28/1

  . Tazocin 25-28/1

  . Cefipime 28-29/1

  . Doxycycline 28-29/1

  . Amikacin 29/1

 

2) Coagulopathy (bleeding via nephrostomies)

- Patient has extensive history of VTEs, was on apixaban 5x2

- Presented with hemoptysis

- Patient has chronic renal vein thrombosis

- Recent admission with bleeding via nephrostomies

- Currently has red urine/blood from both nephrostomies

- She has liver mets

- INR 3.56, PTT 61.6, Fibrinogen 655

- D-Dimer 3.33

- Platelets 382

- Has Hb drop 8.3 > 7.2 > 8.8

- Given 1pRBC unit 26/Jan

- Nephrostomy replacement was cancelled on 28/1 due to elevated INR

 

Plan:

- Apixaban curently on hold 

- Follow Hb level and transfuse as needed

 

3) AKI 

- Cr 0.9 > 1.1 > 1.2 > 1.6

 

On the day of death. Patient became increasingly febrile and tachycardic. Was 

ill-looking and gasping with significant crackles when seen bedside. Patient was

 

then given one shot of amikacin. Family discussion was held with palliative 

fellow and with ICU doctor. Family was informed about patient's poor prognosis, 

but decided against DNR. Family asked about intubation, they were advised 

against it by ICU doctor due to poor prognosis. 

 

One hour later I came to see the patient as she was unresponsive and code was 

called. CPR was attempted and completed 4 cycles with one DC shock on asystole 

at family's insistence! Pulse could not be felt by radial and carotid arteries. 

No breath movements could be observed in either abdomen or chest. Auscultation 

showed no heart beat or breath movements. Pupils were fixed-dilated, unreactive 

to light. 12-lead ECG was done and showed asystole. Patient was declared dead on

Code Status:Full code

Admission Diagnosis:Laryngeal neoplasm

Admission Date:Jun 30,2024

Active Problem: Elective surgery 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Significant finding from history and exam 

********** year-old male patient

Diagnosis: Stage IVA supraglottic laryngeal moderately differentiated squamous 

cell carcinoma; cT3N2.

 

*S/P Definitive concurrent chemoradiation; EBRT as 70Gy/35fx via VMAT + x6 

cycles of weekly carboplatin, concluded on Jun 16, 2022.

 

CT chest may 29/May/2024:

New bilateral bronchopneumonic changes, in the proper clinical setting. Stable 

multiple tiny rounded pulmonary nodules, yet need further follow-up.

 

Neck MRI 29/May/2024:

Further larger in size and more focally extensive right hemi laryngeal contrast 

enhancing infiltrative lesion as now appears as solid contrast enhancing 

diffusion restricted lesion centred at the right supraglottic larynx with marked

 

asymmetric thickening, outline distortion and infiltrative contrast enhancement 

involving the right false and true vocal folds, anterior commissure and now it 

is filling the right para glottic space and extending to the right side thyroid 

cartilage. Fissuring and soft tissue sloughing at left hemilarynx, as before. 

The airways are significantly compromised, more marked than before, apart from 

the tracheostomy. Enlarged lingual tonsils. Left mastoid effusion. Diffuse 

anterior and anterolateral cervical subcutaneous oedematous changes. No newly 

enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Small midline nasopharyngeal cyst likely 

Thornwaldt cyst. The parotid and submandibular glands show no mass. 

Heterogeneous intensity of the thyroid gland. The included part of the brain 

shows no masses. Degenerative changes of the cervical spine with straightening, 

dehydrated narrowed lower cervical disks and degenerative endplate 

spondylodiskitis at C5-6 level.

 

Further progression of the right hemi laryngeal infiltrative lesion, highly 

Suggestive of tumor infiltration more than post-treatment fibrosis or 

Inflammation, redo tissue biopsy /review histopathology is highly advised.

- History of chills and rigors 

- Fever at home 38, afebrile in floor

- CT abdomen 9/12: Newly seen large infiltrative ill-defined hypodense liver 

  mass involving large components of the right hepatic lobe, associated with 

  progressive mild to moderate intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The appearances 

  are most compatible with cholangiocarcinoma, for further evaluation

 

- GI consulted: Do liver biopsy, No role for ERCP at this point

 

- Biopsy from liver lesion done 27/12: 

   . Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with an upper 

     gastrointestinal tract origin, including cholangiocarcinoma

 

- GI reconsulted: do MRCP, ERCP will be done based on result

 

- MRCP on 28/Dec:

  . Diffuse infiltrative poorly defined central hepatic mass involving the 

    entire segments V and VIII with involvement.  Segment VII, IVa and IVb.  The

 

    enhancing pattern is atypical, however, in the presence of extremely 

    elevated CA 19-9, cholangiocarcinoma is highly suggested.

  . There is obstruction and noncommunicating moderate dilatation of the right 

    anterior and posterior intrahepatic bile ducts.

  . There is obliteration of the anterior branch of the right portal vein and 

    narrowing of the left main portal vein as well as right middle hepatic 

    veins.

  . There are several tiny satellite nodules in all liver segments but more 

    condensed in lateral segments of the left lobe.

 

- GI recommendation (31/Dec)>> For ERCP 

 

- ERCP done on 4/Jan:

  . Ampulla: normal looking ampulla with active oozing of blood coming through 

    the ampulla , the procedure was terminated .need urgent IR consult

 

- CTA 4/Jan :

        * No active contrast extravasation to suggest active bleeding.

        * Dilated CBD measuring 1 cm in diameter. Mildly increased left 

        intrahepatic biliary dilatation.

        * Unchanged Filling defect in the subsegmental branches of both lower 

        pulmonary arteries.

 

                   >> IR: no urgent intervention as no active bleeding, 

                          stable patient , no Hb drop 

 

- PTC insertion done on 8/Jan 

- Bil D/Bil T : 11.1/15 >> 10.6/14.2 >>10.2/13.8>>9.72/13.1>> 10.6/14.5

- Bilirubin level is not trending down and the PTC drain output became serous, 

  IR consulted >> For PTC drainage evaluation on sunday 

 

Abx History:

.Tazocin 26/Dec-10/Jan

 

 

>>No role for further PTC or biliary stent, the tumor is hevaliy inflitarting 

the bile duct 

 

>>PTC Drain will be removed before discharge

 

 

2) PE:

- On 9/12: Bilateral lower lobes segmental and subsegmental PE

- On Xarelto at home

Admission Diagnosis:BREAST CA

Admission Date:Jan 3,2024

Active Problem: Elective surgery 

 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Present Illness:

**********yr years old FEMALE patient,medically free,non smoker ,has family history of 

cancer ( maternal aunt :-breast cancer ,paternal aunt:- brain tumor), allergic 

GEMIFLOXACIN

 

genetics: negative

 

Diagnosed with Left breast cancer cT2N1M0

 

past surgical history :- cesarean section

 

Breast MRI:

Irregular enhancing mass at the left breast upper outer quadrant associated with

 

similar mass anterior to it and non mass-like enhancement.

Multiple abnormal left axillary lymph nodes

Enhancing mass in the right breast

 

 

MAMMO REVIEW 

Findings: 

The breast tissue are heterogeneously dense. This may obscure underlying 

abnormality.

 

Left breast:

Multiple oval masses with indistinct margins occupying the upper outer 

quadrant of the left breast, best seen on DBT views.  There are multiple 

associated groups of pleomorphic microcalcifications involving the upper outer 

quadrant and extending towards the nipple. The most prominent at about for 4.3 

cm from the nipple.

 

The masses and the calcifications measure collectively about 5.6 x 5.5 x 

7.2 cm in transverse, AP and CC diameters respectively.  This likely correlates 

with a newly-diagnosed left breast cancer.  However further correlation with 

ultrasound is advised.

 

RIGHT BREAST; TRU-CUT BIOPSY: 

Sclerosing adenosis and complex fibroadenoma. 

Calcification present.

 

LEFT BREAST; TRU-CUT BIOPSY: 

 

High-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, solid with comedo necrosis. 

 

Estrogen receptors: Positive, strong, in 100% of invasive tumor cell 

nuclei. 

 

Progesterone receptors: Positive, strong, in 3% of invasive tumor

cell nuclei. 

 

HER2/neu over expression: Negative, Score (1+). 

Ki67: 30 

 

LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE; TRU-CUT BIOPSY: 

 

Metastatic mammary carcinoma. 

 

staging negative 

 

plan: for neoadjuvant chemotherapy 

 

s/p AC*3 , ONE CYCLE TAXOTERE DID NOT TOLERATE IT ,SWITCHED TO TAXOL FOR 9 CYCLE

 

 COMPLETED  IT  ON 29/11/2023 

 

 

PLAN:

FOLLOW UP MAMMOGRAM & U/S 

 

There is interval decrease in the size and density of the known malignant 

masses at upper outer quadrant of the left breast with multiple residual 

pleomorphic microcalcifications extending to the nipple cyst.

There is interval decrease in the size of the known metastatic left 

axillary lymph nodes with mild residual cortical thickening.

The above described findings in the breast and axilla indicates partial 

treatment response.

 

 

CAP 

No residual left breast tumour or left axillary lymphadenopathy.

No distant metastasis.

Significant finding from history and exam 

 

**********yr years old MALE patient, MF, NKA.

Diagnosed with papillary thyroid ca 

 

12/2023: CT neck 

Mildly enlarged lower cervical/uper mediastinal lymph nodes just below the 

thyroid gland measuring 1.2 and 1.1 cm short axis respectively. There is large 

cystic lesion noted in the right side of the neck measures 4.9 x 3.1 cm longest 

axial diameters, suggesting cystic/necrotic lymphadenopathy versus less likely 

congenital brachial cyst, need tissue biopsy. Thyroid gland appears homogenous 

with no definite significant focal lesion can could be detected by CT scan, 

ultrasound is more sensitive for the thyroid gland. Unremarkable rest of the 

neck structures. Unremarkable aerodigestive tract apart from slightly enlarged 

lymphoid tissue like adenoids and tonsils. Unremarkable paranasal sinuses and 

mastoids. Unremarkable visualised bony structures. 

 

sp Neck cystic mass; excision.  7/4/2024

 

MACROSCOPIC-AS PER OUTSIDE REPORT: 

Four cystic masses, the largest measuring 8x5x4 cm, on sectioning

filled with brownish fluid. Intact lymph nodes are present, the

largest is 2.5x1.5x1 cm. 

 

 

      DIAGNOSIS: 

 

      LARGE CYSTIC NECK MASS, EXCISION: 

 

       Lymph nodes involved by metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma with 

      extranodal extension. 

       Uninvolved reactive lymph nodes are also present.

 

 

 

Neck us :28/4/2024

There is small hypoechoic nodule showing ring calcifications in the lower part 

of the right thyroid lobe, it measures 4 mm in maximum 

diameter, this nodule is moderately suspicious for thyroid cancer (TR4), no 

other focal thyroid nodule could be detected. There is 

prominent, relatively hypoechoic with thick cortex lymph node in the right upper

 

neck lateral to the upper part of the right internal 

jugular vein at level III measuring 7 mm in short axis diameter, this could 

represent diseased lymph, smaller scattered and prominent 

lymph nodes are noted in both sides of the neck and these are probably reactive 

lymph nodes

 

The patient was admitted for Total thyroidectomy +CLND+RT MRND +Lt neck 

exploration, he has signed the consent form for surgery after it was explained,

Patient quit smoking 2 months ago. Before that patient used to smoke 4 packs/day

 

DIAGNOSIS:

Laryngeal CA.

 

STAGING:

T4aN0M0

 

PREVIOUS TREATMENT:

None

 

PATHOLOGY:

A-LARYNX; BIOPSY: 

      Invasive well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. 

 

B-RIGHT VOCAL CORD; BIOPSY: 

      Large pieces of laryngeal tissue with mild dysplasia, focus of

PET scan :

- Large hypermetabolic right laryngeal tumor with cartilaginous invasion and 

extra-laryngeal extension, as described above, compatible with biopsy-proven 

primary neoplasm. 

- Mildly hypermetabolic, bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymph 

nodes, as well as few ground glass nodularities and hazy opacities in both lungs

 

of subtle FDG uptake; Picture of which is suggestive of 

granulomatous/inflammtory process rather than metastases. 

- No evidence of any other concerning hypermetabolic lesions. For clinical 

correlation. 

- Other ancillary findings as described above.

 

Neck MRI :

- Large laryngeal tumour with cartilagenous invasion and extra laryngeal 

extensions, T4a disease. 

- Right postcricoid tumour extension approaching the right carotid sheath but 

not yet evidence of complete encasement of the right internal carotid artery .

Course During Hospitalization and discharge plan

-------------------------------------------------

The patient presented to the emergency room with one day of vomiting, 

increased occipital headache, and dizziness. There were no signs of loss of 

consciousness, abnormal body movements, blurry vision, abdominal pain, or 

changes in bowel movements. Neurological evaluation confirmed no weakness or 

paresthesia. The patient has a history of brain metastases and was 

experiencing worsening symptoms attributed to vasogenic edema.

 *A CT scan in the ER indicated increased vasogenic edema in the cerebellum, 

leading to compression of the lateral ventricle.

* The surgery team was consulted and found no surgical intervention necessary. 

The patient received their first session of whole brain radiotherapy (30Gy in 

10 fractions) yesturday, with a total of 2 sessions and 10 already planned.

* Discussions regarding life expectancy were held with Dr. **********am, who 

indicated a prognosis of more than six months.

 

 

* The discharge plan includes :

                -  dexamethasone (4mg four times),and tappering with clinic 

                after radiotherapy sessions 

                - f/u of the official CT report, a follow-up brain MRI, 

                - follow-up with the radiation oncology team.

                - Ondansetron is prescribed as needed for nausea. 

                - Will recive 3rd radiotherapy session today before discharge 

                - Patient reported chronic constipation improving with biscodyl 

                will be discharge with biscodyl 5mg bid prn

 

The patient's stay went well, with improvement in her 

condition. As he is now stable and in good shape, we?re planning for her 

discharge. She will continue his current medications at home 

and will need to follow up with her primary care provider as scheduled.

 We?ve provided clear instructions on what to watch for and when to reach out 

if any concerns arise

Important development during hospitalization

 

The patient was admitted with increasing back pain over the past three weeks, 

raising concerns for potential spinal cord compression. However, she exhibited 

no neurological symptoms such as saddle anesthesia or urinary incontinence, 

and physical examination revealed no lower limb weakness or sensory deficits. 

Surgical consultation was obtained, and the plan included admission to the 

medical team, an MRI with contrast, a CT scan of the whole spine without 

contrast, and initiation of dexamethasone. The CT scan of the whole spine 

showed no vertebral collapse or gross lesions, though the final assessment 

awaits MRI results. Following the CT scan, the surgical team was reconsulted 

and advised awaiting MRI results before further action. The current plan 

involves proceeding with a whole spine MRI to rule out cord compression, with 

follow-up surgery consultation based on the MRI findings. The patient was 

given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily.

 

MRI of the whole spine revealed no cord compression.

Patient will be discharged to continue pain medications, paracetamol 1000mg 

TID + Tramadol 50mg PRN.

Important development during hospitalization

 

A **********-year-old gentleman has been diagnosed with moderately 

differentiated rectal 

adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the lymph nodes. He recently 

underwent a 

robotic-assisted low anterior resection with diverting ileostomy 

on May 19, 

2024. He is scheduled for total neoadjuvant therapy, with XELOX 

chemotherapy 

regimen, last cycle #9 in April 2024. 

 

Today he presents to ER for unusual altered balance he noticed 

last few days 

when he walks. He did not have any injuries or falling down 

incidents. He has 

had no nausea, fever or chills. He does have a headache frontally 

and 

ocipitally, compressive in nature.  No vomiting.

==========

                        Assessment and Plan of Care

=================================================================

========== 

A **********-year-old gentleman has been diagnosed with moderately 

differentiated rectal 

adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the lymph nodes. He recently 

underwent a 

robotic-assisted low anterior resection with diverting ileostomy 

on May 19, 

2024. He is scheduled for total neoadjuvant therapy, with XELOX 

chemotherapy 

regimen, last cycle #9 in April 2024. 

 

He presents today for admission to undergo further evaluation 

with an MRI of the 

brain due to new findings on a CT scan, which revealed a 

cerebellar lesion with 

vasogenic edema.

 

=============

Active Issues during the admission 

=============

 

1) Cerebellar Lesion + Vasogenic Edema + Tonsillar Herniation :

- History: altered balance when walking

- Exam: normal pupillary reflexes bilaterally. no weakness or 

focal neurological 

deficits. upon walking he has an unusual gait, and patient 

Romberg sign was +

- Investigations

- CT Brain (Prelim)

                -Rounded slightly hyperdense left cerebellar 

lesion is seen 

measuring about 2.2 x 2.3 cm in maximum sagittal dimensions, 

surrounded by 

vasogenic oedema, causing cerebellar tonsillar herniation by 0.3 

cm, crowding 

the foramen magnum and exerting compression upon the medulla 

oblongata. This 

needs further evaluation by brain MRI. Also, significant 

compression upon the 

fourth ventricle is seen with resultant upstream third and 

lateral ventricular 

dilatation with surrounding transependymal CSF seepage suggesting 

obstructive 

hydrocephalus. No midline shift is seen. Bilatearl heavy ganglia 

and bifrontal 

gyral calcifications are seen (appear unchanged compared to 

remote PET CT in 

2023) carrying differentials including 

idiopathic/metabolic/previous infection.

 

Impression: Possibly brain metastasis

 

** brain mri :

Enhancing mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere with moderate 

surrounding 

oedema, the mass measures up to 3.3 cm on axial images, there is 

compression 

upon the fourth ventricle and moderate proximal ventricular 

dilatation. There is 

resultant crowding at foramen magnum. This is most correlating 

with metastasis. 

Tiny enhancement in the medulla oblongata is also likely 

metastatic

 

** neurosurgery plan : The patient case was reviewed by dr ********** 

**********qa********** and his 

impression was to 

keep the patient on dexamethasone and RTC the patient to 

NEUROSURGERY clinic 

on wednesday (2/10/2024)

 

** radiotherapy conatcted : follow with us afetr neurosurgery 

decision if 

surgical intervention is to be done 

 

** cap ct done : 

New right paravertebral fifth rib destructive bone lesion with 

soft tissue 

components measuring up to 3.3 cm suggestive of metastasis. New 

bilateral 

adrenal glands nodules suggestive of metastases. What is seen of 

the brain is 

remarkable for left cerebellar enhancing lesion measuring up to 3 

cm suggestive 

of brain metastasis.

 

** CEA 13.2 

 

 

Plan : patient and examined

- admitted as gait found to have brain lesion in keeping with new 

- patietn is doing well no active complaints , his gait improved , instructed to

 

assessed at all times by his famliy , fit for discharge at this point 

- will be discharegd on tappering dxa , follow up dose tomorrow in the 

neurosurgery clinic 

- upon dc :  rtc neurosurgery on wednesday (tomorow)  , rtc surgery for stma 

closurein **********ek , rtc radiotherapy clinic afetr neurosurgery appoitnment (to 

deciede on radiotherapy)

- rtc dr **********lfah's clinic next week (to decied if no neurosurgical intervention

in the inferior lingula and trace left-sided pleural effusion. He was commenced 

on Tazocin 4500 mg IV Q8H, started on 25 September and O2 requirments were 

monitored. A speech and swallow consultation was performed, recommending thick 

liquids if oral feeding continues, with feeding tube placement advised for 

stabilization. The NG tube was removed on 30/SEP , and thick fluids were 

initiated. 

 

>> Orthopnea and Abdominal Distension: 

The patient has experienced orthopnea for 10 days, with abdominal distension at 

baseline and pitting edema in lower limbs (ankle to knee). No jugular venous 

distention or bibasilar crackles noted. Labs showed albumin 3.1 and protein 

(serum) 5.6, with imaging confirming trace left-sided pleural effusion. An 

abdominal ultrasound indicated moderate diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver 

without ascites or focal lesions. Nutritionist was consulted for hypoalbuminemia

 

and recommended to change diet based on speech therapy evaluation .

 

 

>>  Altered Mental Status: 

The patient presented with ataxia, dysphagia, expressive aphasia, and urinary 

incontinence. Neurological examination showed 0/5 strength in the right upper 

and lower limbs and 2/5 strength in the left limbs. The tongue was deviated to 

the right. Previous MRI results noted left-sided vasogenic edema with a 

hemorrhagic component, and oral ulcers were observed. 

 

CT of the brain indicated no significant interval changes or acute brain insult.

 

He was commenced on NPO status, aspiration precautions, dexamethasone 4 mg TID.,

 

levetiracetam 500 mg BID.

 

>> For follow-Up:

 The patient is scheduled for follow-up in his primaary doctor clinic and will 

continue to be monitored for clinical status changes. Further nutritional 

support and respiratory assessments are recommended.

A ********** Year  old male patient referred from ALISTI**********L **********OSPITAL , diagnosed with 

CGD 

positive oxidative burst test (DHR) positive 7TH -FEB-2018 ,genetic test was 

sent to ********** still pending . 

 

His history dates back since he was 7 months of age 

started to suffer from recurrent skin abscess in his limbs ,knee were managed by

 

multiple times of incision and drainage and course antibiotics for about one 

week as in-patient and was discharged home . 

-He had history of osteomyelitis in RT knee in 2019 was managed by long course 

IV antibiotics and he underwent incision and drainage and resolved . 

-He also had history of RT mastoiditis in 2022  that was managed by parenteral 

antibiotics and grommet tubes was inserted and resolved .

-Left hand swelling in 2023 diagnosed initially as linear fracture then his 

swelling progressed to abscess managed by IV antibiotics and drainage and 

resolved . 

 

-Last February he had onset of cough and fever with elevated inflammatory 

markers CXR showed Lt lower consolidation , initially was managed by steroid, iv

 

antibiotics and nebulizers then he underwent chest CT in 25th Feb showed LT 

lower consolidation with multiple cavitation complicated by retroperitoneal 

abscess and pleural effusion with reactive multiple mediastinal lymph nodes ;was

 

managed by voriconzole (he developed hallucinations ,hypotension and cyanosis ) 

needed to be admitted to PICU for observation one day and was transferred to 

floor , then anti-fungal was switched to liposomal-amphotericin complicated by 

hypokalemia, CVP was inserted and was managed by potassium replacement .

he received liposomal amphotericin for initially for about 28 days , stopped for

 

two weeks then restarted since 1/May/2024,vancomycin and ceftazidime for short 

time then was discontinued . 

Then his clinical case worsened by progressive LT lower back swelling filled 

with pus culture showed aspergillosis involving rib number 11th and 12 ,

managed by wound debridement under GA ,Surgical team recommended to do wound 

dressing q3 days under GA . 

 

-********** also suffers from sever recurrent vomiting and epigastric pain , underwent

 

upper scope BY DR.MOHAMME********** **********WASHDEH showed sever gastritis without active 

ulcers with elements of esophagitis and small hiatal hernia . 

 

-He has bad nutritional status ,received only amminoplasmin at **********IS**********AL 

hospital. 

 

-The patient has an unremarkable perinatal course except for C/S due to previous

 

scar.

 

-up to age according to **********ian schedule ,except he did not receive vaccine at

 

age of ********** months. he received BCG with out any complications .

 

 

-Family history is positive for:

3 of maternal uncle died at young age of :

**********day old with multiple infection .

2nd maternal uncle died at age of ********** year with infection .

3rd maternal uncle died at age of ********** months with multiple infections .

 

 

---------------------------In patient Course------------------------------------

ID:

-------------------

At the time of presentation to **********C he was afebrile

Inflammatory markers were sent (PCT 4.2, CRP **********)

blood culture was collected: no growth so far

Glactomann: negative

Pan CT :  Sinuses, chest, abdomen and pelvis CT scan with IV contrast 

Comparison:  None 

Findings: Sinuses CT scan The paranasal sinuses and mastoid 

air cells are clear. No bone destruction.  Chest CT scan There is patchy 

consolidations involving the left upper and lower lung lobes, suggestive of 

pneumonia in the proper clinical settings. No pulmonary consolidation in the 

right lung. There is no enlarged intrathoracic or axillary lymph node. No 

pleural effusion. Right Port-A-Cath with its tip in cavoatrial junction. 

Abdomen and pelvis CT scan There is hepatomegaly.  Liver span at mid clavicular 

line is 15.3 cm.  No focal lesion. The splenic size is 9 cm in longitudinal 

diameter.  Borderline for his age. The longitudinal diameter of the left kidney 

is 12 cm. The longitudinal diameter of right kidney is 10.3 cm.  There is no 

hydronephrosis. There is no enlarged lymph node in the abdomen or pelvis. There 

is no focal hepatic or splenic lesion. Pancreas and both adrenal glands are 

unremarkable. Unremarkable urinary bladder. No intra-abdominal or pelvic 

abscess. No bowel dilatation. There is subcutaneous calcified lesion with sinus 

tract to the overlying skin in left upper abdomen, likely representing the known

 

skin abscess. For better clinical evaluation.  Impression: Patchy consolidations

 

in left upper and lower lung lobes, suggestive of pneumonia in the proper 

clinical settings. Hepatomegaly.  Liver span is 15.3 cm. The splenic 

longitudinal diameter is 9 cm (borderline for his age). No abdominal or pelvic 

abscess. No signs of acute sinusitis.

 

at presentation the patient continued on amphotericin to complete the course of 

antifungal treatment (aspergillus removed from abscess), considering his active 

chest infection he was started on pipercillin/tazobctam and vancomycin (which 

was refused by the mother)

Surgery team was requested :recommended that first evaluation of abscess to be 

as EUA but the patient was considered as not fit by anesthesia team considering 

his active chest infection, Surgery team (including surgery consultant) tried to

 

talk to the mother to convince her and her child to evaluate the wound and if 

deemed necessary will do sedation and dressing first but she refused to allow 

them to see the wound

 

 

Renal and electrolytes:

-----------------------

Since presentation to **********HCC the patient was found to have multiple electrolyte 

levels (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia)

on the day of discharge against medical advice his potassium level was 2.5 (the 

mother refused to give him aldlactone) ECG was done and showed ECG changes he 

was given potassium bolus as 1meq/kg/dose and he was given calcium gluconate as 

cardio protective , his magnesium level was 1.3, he was given magnesium bolus

follow up:

K= 3.74

Calcium adjusted = 9

**the patient was planed for follow up ECG the mother refused to attach the 

leads

 

 

Nutrition:

-----------------

the patient was evaluated by nutrition team considering the reported weight loss

 

of 10 Kg and recurrent vomiting and nill oral intake

the patient was put on ondansetron and metoclopramide regular alternating and 

esomeprazole, the mother refused metoclopramide because it is not considered 

beneficial for him

 

 

Social and Family related issues:

----------------------------------

the patient was admitted to **********HC********** on 24/May/2024

Since then the patient has been accompanied by his mother .

The mother has been refusing medical care including:

1-antibiotics (vancomycin even though it is considered of top importance in her 

son's condition considering his primary diagnoses of CGD and current chest 

infection)

**oral and IV medications (objecting to necessity , route and timing of 

administration, being unconvinced by medical rational despite trying to explain 

it to her):

2-Refused spironolactone despite having hypokalemia, convinced that it only 

should be used with loop diuretics, as a result his potassium level became 2.5 

associated with ECG changes , despite  explaining to her that refusing potassium

 

has lead to this.

3-refused the use of antiemetic despite reporting that he has persistent 

vomiting 

4-refused to take PO medications at 8:00AM and wants to give them at 12:00Md 

when the nurse went to give them at 12 as her request she started screaming at 

the nurse that the nurses are not compliant to timing of medications

 

5-physical examination

  patient was planed for regular physical exam to evaluate for possible sites of

 

infection, and to evaluate the wound that was drained 1 week ago, and she wants 

him to be touched only under general anesthesia, he was evaluated by anesthesia 

team and was seen as not fit considering his active chest infection, the mother 

wants to give him propofol at bed side to evaluate him despite the fact that it 

was explained to her that is not right to do as per medical practice and against

 

policy at **********HC**********

 

6-she has also been interfering with medical decision and treating all parts of 

medical team (pediatric physicians, Surgery  physicians and nurses )  in an 

uncivil and impolite way.

On the day of discharge against medical advice she had a fight with two assigned

 

nurses (In two separate occasions), she refused medical evaluation by surgery 

and pediatric team , started screaming asking to be discharged NOW without 

delay.

It was explained to her that her sons' potassium level is critically low and it 

needs correction before any AMA.

**patient was discharged after correction of K level , mother signed AMA 

 

7-mother was not convinced by allogenic-transplant and she said literally to 

medical staff that she Came to **********HC********** for TPN !!

Significant finding from history and exam 

A ********** year old lady, with PMHx of DM, a case of GB Adenocarcinoma with mets to 

liver and peritoneum.

- S/P laprotomy for cholecycstectomy, liver wedge resection by Dr **********er 

  22/10/2023 clips were removed 5/11/2023 

- S/P chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin and xelox in Jan, 2024. Poorly 

  tolerated, with disease progression

 

Recent admission on Feb,2024 due to obstructive hyperbilirubinemia, during 

which she underwent ERCP with stent placement. Then she was admitted again on 

22/3 with severe vomiting and electrolyte disturbances due to gastric outlet 

obstruction. Stent placed on 31/3, However patient still complained of abdominal

 

pain and vomiting. Barium meal was done and showed nonfunctioning stent, for 

repeat endoscopy.

 

Repeted EGD on 7/4: stent looked patent, luminal narrowing in the distal DIII 

caused by Ext compression, the case was discussed with the primary, Given the 

risk of migration, perforation and bleeding, given trial of radiotherapy (one 

fraction of radiation 8 Gy). Patient was then readmitted with gastric outlet 

obstruction.

 

    >>> Admitted as a case of gastric outlet obstruction due to tumor 

        compression after failed stenting. Initially planned for surgical

        procedure and was started on PPN, however her stay was then further 

        complicated with sepsis and pulmonary embolism making her not fit for 

        procedure. Family then opted for palliative referral were leaning

        towards symptom management for her overall condition, but still

--------------

1) Sepsis and respiratory distress (PE/Left pleural effusion ± Pneumonia/UTI) 

- The patient complained of SOB on 2/May. Patient denied cough or chest pain. 

  Complained of fever and shivering. Was ill-looking, in moderate distress, 

  Became febrile and hypotensive

- Tazocin was upgraded to meropenem, received one shot amikacin, and 100mg

  hydrocortisone

- ECG was done and showed sinus tachycardia at rate 154 and prolonged 

  QT of 510

- PCT 29.8

- CT PE on 2/May verbal report:

  . Filling defect in lingular branch

  . Moderate left pleural effusuin 

  . Right lower lobe consolidation suggestive of infection 

- Blood Cx: ECOLI, K.PNEUMONAE, STAPH HOMINIS 

- Urine Cx: Klebsiella ESBL -ve

- PPN discontinued as the patient has sepsis and has been on PPN for 8 days 

- Last fever was documented on 13 MAY AM. 

- VBGs on 18/5: Unremarkable

- Left pleural inserted 20/5

- Patient developed fever and hypotension on 21/5. Patient was ill-looking, cold

 

  extremities, anuric. Antibiotics were restarted and cultures were sent. 

  Explained to the family that the patient has extremely poor prognosis and is 

  likely to pass within a few days. Code was rediscussed, still insisted on full

 

  code.

- ABx history:

  . Vancomycin 4-18/5, 23-25/5

  . Meropenem 5-18/5, 23-Death

 

2) AKI

- Cr 0.8 > 1.5 > 1.9

- Oligouric > Anuric

- Overloaded

- Patient has borderline BP, septic

- Vancomycin trough 31

 

3) Gastric outlet obstruction/Ascites:

- Initial Presentation with abdominal pain and vomiting causing severe 

  electrolyte disturbances. On exam there was tenderness to superficial 

  palpation mainly in the epigastric, periumbilical and RUQ. GI were consulted 

  and asked for EGD.

- EGD 26/3 showed mild stenosis and initially GI said no indication for 

  stenting. However symptoms progressed and eventually metallic stent was 

  inserted on 31/3.

- Patient still complained of abdominal pain and vomiting after stenting. GI 

  were consulted and recommended for barium meal and follow through which 

  showed nonfunctioning stent vs vs obstuction just distal to 

  stent. EGD was repeated and showed external compression. Due to high risk the 

  case was discused with primary and patient given radiotherapy (one fraction)

- After radiotherapy patient still had abdominal pain and vomiting causing her 

  to re-present to ER on 23/4

- CT-AP 23/4:

  . Status post duodenal stent insertion. No bowel obstruction. 

  . Progressing peritoneal carcinomatosis with new mild amount of ascites. 

  . Progressing hepatic metastases.

  . Unchanged matted upper retroperitoneal lymph nodes invading the left adrenal

 

    gland and left renal vein.

- Surgery on 24/April: to do feeding jejunostomy and venting gastrostromy by the

 

  IR team. 

- Surgery on 25/April: 

  . Dr B**********l ********** decided to attempt surgical gastrojejunostomy on Monday 

    vs. venting gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy

  . Optimization of patient is needed

  . TPN 

  . Daily labs

- The patient completed 8 days of PPN, she was planned to place PICC line for 

  central TPN, but developed sepsis, thus PPN was stopped on 5/May.

- Peritoneal drain inserted 20/5

- Case was discussed with the patient and her family. Agreed not to do procedure

 

  for her gastric outlet obstruction and to only do symptom management.

 

On 26/5, patient became increasingly hypoxic and hypotensive. O2 saturation 

dropped to 60s on nonrebreather at max settings and BP to 50/30, patient was 

ill-looking and had labored gasping breathing. ICU were called at that point as 

patient's family was insisting on full code. Before ICU doctor arrived patient's

 

pulse became unrecordable and code was called. CPR was attempted and patient 

**********erwent two cycles of compressions without regaining spontaneous circulation.

After that, pulse could not be felt by radial and carotid arteries. No breath 

movements could be observed in either abdomen or chest. Auscultation showed no 

heart beat or breath movements. Pupils were fixed-dilated, unreactive to light. 

ECG was done and showed asystole. Patient was declared dead on 20:38

### DAY ZERO OF TRANSPLANT : 6/2/2024 

 

autogenic stem cell infusion

The procedure was performed under complete aseptic technique. The patient was 

pre-medicated with 1gm PO acetaminophen, 100mg IV hydrocortisone and 5mg IV 

allerfin.

Component ID and correct patient ID were double checked before infusion.

Became hypoxic and anuric. 

Underwent first sessioin HD 24/5, after dialysis developed sudden decrease level

 

of consciousness and was intubated upon arrival to ICU. 

 

 

Assessment and Plan: 

====================

1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE 

        - VOLUME OVERLOAD AND POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA

        - INTUBATED UPON ARRIVAL TO ICU ON 24/5 DUE TO GASPINE BREATHING

        - SATRTED ON DIALYSIS

        - Underwent two session dialysis 2 liters each session. 

        - ON IV ABx

        - ON STEROID

 

        - CT CHEST ON 24/5 :

        New bilateral interstitial thickening and bilateral faint groundglass 

        opacity, suggestive of changes of fluid overload/interstitial pulmonary 

        oedema. 

        No gross pneumonic consolidation. Increased mild right-sided pleural 

        effusion with increased right basal atelectasis. New mild left-sided 

        pleural effusion with left basal atelectasis. New trace amount of 

        pericardial effusion. Mildly enlarging intrathoracic lymph nodes.

 

        Underwent two sessions dialysis with 2liter removal each.
