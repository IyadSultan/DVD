arising from left ovary.  The tumour 

consists of unilocular haemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with 

numerous papillary 

projections measuring up to 1.2 

cm. The tumour is abutting the bladder dome and right ovary. 

There are a few 

right ovarian follicles measuring up 

to 2 cm. No pelvic lymphadenopathy.   The uterus is 

retroflexed.  There is 

endometrial thickening measuring 2.2 

cm. No cervical mass. No destructive bone lesion.

Findings: 

CHEST 

Multiple bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes measuring 

up to 1 cm in 

short axis. Two tiny nodules in the 

left lung No lung consolidation or air space shadowing. No 

significant axillary 

lymphadenopathy. No pleural or 

pericardial effusion. 

ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 

A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion most likely arising from the left 

ovary 

compressing the urinary bladder. No ascites.

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left temporal brain metastases versus lymphoma  
**Admission Date:** June 25, 2024  

**Active Problem:** Elective surgery for navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Examination:**  

The patient is a female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017, characterized as ER-/PR+60%/HER2+. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by left modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017. Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma, with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes positive, classified as ypT0N1. Subsequent adjuvant external beam radiation therapy was administered to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completed on January 30, 2018. The patient also received adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen therapy.

**Brain MRI:**  
Two lesions in the left temporal lobe, close to the CSF, with diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggesting a possible CNS lymphoma versus brain metastases. No leptomeningeal metastasis noted. Follow-up MRI indicated interval enlargement of these lesions with mild increased edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. Histopathological correlation was advised.

**Significant Laboratory and Radiology Findings:**  
None reported.

**Code Status:** Full code  

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left temporal brain metastases versus lymphoma  
**Admission Date:** June 25, 2024  

**Active Problem:** Elective surgery for navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Examination:**  

The patient is a female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017, characterized as ER-/PR+60%/HER2+.
She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by left modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017.
Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma, with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes positive, classified as ypT0N1.
Subsequent adjuvant external beam radiation therapy was administered to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completed on January 30, 2018.
The patient also received adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen therapy.
**Brain MRI:**  
Two lesions in the left temporal lobe, close to the CSF, with diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggesting a possible CNS lymphoma versus brain metastases.
No leptomeningeal metastasis noted.
Follow-up MRI indicated interval enlargement of these lesions with mild increased edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma.
Histopathological correlation was advised.
**Significant Laboratory and Radiology Findings:**  
None reported.

She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by left modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017. Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma, with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes positive, classified as ypT0N1. Subsequent adjuvant external beam radiation therapy was administered to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completed on January 30, 2018. The patient also received adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen therapy.

**Brain MRI:**  
Two lesions in the left temporal lobe, close to the CSF, with diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggesting a possible CNS lymphoma versus brain metastases. No leptomeningeal metastasis noted. Follow-up MRI indicated interval enlargement of these lesions with mild increased edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. Histopathological correlation was advised.

**Significant Laboratory and Radiology Findings:**  
None reported.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

---

**Code Status:** Full code  

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left temporal brain metastases versus lymphoma  
**Admission Date:** June 25, 2024  

**Active Problem:** Elective surgery for navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Examination:**  

The patient is a female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017, characterized as ER-/PR+60%/HER2+. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by left modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017. Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma, with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes positive, classified as ypT0N1. Subsequent adjuvant external beam radiation therapy was administered to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completed on January 30, 2018. The patient also received adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen therapy.

**Brain MRI:**  
Two lesions in the left temporal lobe, close to the CSF, with diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggesting a possible CNS lymphoma versus brain metastases. No leptomeningeal metastasis noted. Follow-up MRI indicated interval enlargement of these lesions with mild increased edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. Histopathological correlation was advised.

**Significant Laboratory and Radiology Findings:**  
None reported.

---

**Procedures Performed During Hospitalization:**  
- Navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Important Developments During Hospitalization:**  

The neurosurgery team assessed the patient. She was well, conscious, alert, and oriented, with no respiratory distress. The patient tolerated her diet, underwent chest physiotherapy, and was encouraged to ambulate. Wound inspection revealed no erythema and minimal discharge. Dr. [Redacted] was consulted for hypertension management, leading to the addition of Amlodipine 5 mg BID and Candesartan 16 mg BID.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Head and Neck: No pallor, jaundice, or cervical lymphadenopathy  
- Respiratory: Bilateral vesicular breath sounds, no added sounds  
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, no rubs, murmurs, JVD, or bilateral lower limb edema  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no rigidity or rebound tenderness  
- Neurological: Conscious, alert, oriented, GCS 15/15, freely moving all limbs  

The patient was deemed fit for discharge.

**Active Problem:**  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Examination:**  

The patient is a female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017, characterized as ER-/PR+60%/HER2+. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by left modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017. Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma, with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes positive, classified as ypT0N1. Subsequent adjuvant external beam radiation therapy was administered to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completed on January 30, 2018. The patient also received adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen therapy.

**Brain MRI:**  
Two lesions in the left temporal lobe, close to the CSF, with diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggesting a possible CNS lymphoma versus brain metastases. No leptomeningeal metastasis noted. Follow-up MRI indicated interval enlargement of these lesions with mild increased edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. Histopathological correlation was advised.

**Significant Laboratory and Radiology Findings:**  
None reported.

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left temporal brain metastases versus lymphoma  
**Admission Date:** June 25, 2024  

**Active Problem:** Elective surgery for navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Examination:**  

The patient is a female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017, characterized as ER-/PR+60%/HER2+. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by left modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017. Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma, with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes positive, classified as ypT0N1. Subsequent adjuvant external beam radiation therapy was administered to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completed on January 30, 2018. The patient also received adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen therapy.

**Brain MRI:**  
Two lesions in the left temporal lobe, close to the CSF, with diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggesting a possible CNS lymphoma versus brain metastases. No leptomeningeal metastasis noted. Follow-up MRI indicated interval enlargement of these lesions with mild increased edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. Histopathological correlation was advised.

**Significant Laboratory and Radiology Findings:**  
None reported.

---

**Procedures Performed During Hospitalization:**  
- Navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Important Developments During Hospitalization:**  

The neurosurgery team assessed the patient. She was well, conscious, alert, and oriented, with no respiratory distress. The patient tolerated her diet, underwent chest physiotherapy, and was encouraged to ambulate. Wound inspection revealed no erythema and minimal discharge. Dr. [Redacted] was consulted for hypertension management, leading to the addition of Amlodipine 5 mg BID and Candesartan 16 mg BID.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Head and Neck: No pallor, jaundice, or cervical lymphadenopathy  
- Respiratory: Bilateral vesicular breath sounds, no added sounds  
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, no rubs, murmurs, JVD, or bilateral lower limb edema  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no rigidity or rebound tenderness  
- Neurological: Conscious, alert, oriented, GCS 15/15, freely moving all limbs  

The patient was deemed fit for discharge.

S/P:  SBRT to the liver; end Date: Jun 27,2023, at dose of 

60Gy/5Fx.
The patient presented yesterday with sever abdominal pain , vomitting , decrease

 

output from stoma with last bowel motion 1 day ago 

 

CAP CT abdomen: 

There is small bowel dilitation, faecalization and air-fluid level with a 

maximum diameter of 4.
5 cm , along with mild bowel wall thickening and some 

fat stranding.
No pneumoperitonium.
No free fluid.
The patient was admitted for conservative managemetn (NPO + IV fluid)

 

Follow up CT with oral contrast was requested today whioch revealed an 

increasing small bowel diameter (around 5.
5 cm) with a persistrant transional 

point at the level of parastomal hernia.
We were also infomred of a new terminal

 

ileal mass (Away from the transition point) that's of suspeciosu apperance.

- No known drug allergies  

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a case of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. Post sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, the procedure was complicated by an anastomotic leak and colo-cutaneous fistula, necessitating a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. There is no role for adjuvant chemotherapy as the window period has passed. The patient completed SBRT to the liver on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60 Gy in 5 fractions.

**Recent Presentation:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased stoma output, with the last bowel movement one day prior. A CT scan of the abdomen showed small bowel dilation, fecalization, and air-fluid levels with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding, but without pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

**Management and Findings:**  
The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring due to the risk of postoperative complications. The patient was managed conservatively with NPO and IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast revealed increased small bowel diameter and a persistent transition point at the parastomal hernia level. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
- **Temperature:** 98.8 F (37.1 C)  
- **Pulse:** 108  
- **Respirations:** 18  
- **Blood Pressure:** 100/59  
- **Pulse Oximetry:** 93%  

**Laboratory Data:**  
- White Blood Cell Count: 11 -> 7.3  
- Lactate: 2.8 -> 1.7  

**Interventions:**  
- IV fluids at 120 cc/hr  
- Nasogastric tube output: 400 cc bilious  
- Urine output: Adequate  

**Consultation:**  
Discussed with Dr. Bilal \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Due to increasing bowel diameter and tachycardia, an urgent parastomal hernia repair (without mesh) was indicated.

**Risks and Complications Explained:**  
Potential risks include leak, bleeding, hematoma, recurrence, with ACS risk scores indicating above-average risk for complications.

**Active Problem:** Abdominal pain  

---

**Medical History:**  
- Diabetes Mellitus (DM)  
- No known drug allergies  

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a case of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. Post sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, the procedure was complicated by an anastomotic leak and colo-cutaneous fistula, necessitating a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. There is no role for adjuvant chemotherapy as the window period has passed. The patient completed SBRT to the liver on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60 Gy in 5 fractions.

**Recent Presentation:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased stoma output, with the last bowel movement one day prior. A CT scan of the abdomen showed small bowel dilation, fecalization, and air-fluid levels with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding, but without pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

**Management and Findings:**  
The patient was managed conservatively with NPO and IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast revealed increased small bowel diameter and a persistent transition point at the parastomal hernia level. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
- **Temperature:** 98.8 F (37.1 C)  
- **Pulse:** 108  
- **Respirations:** 18  
- **Blood Pressure:** 100/59

**Medical History:**  
- Diabetes Mellitus (DM)  

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a case of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. The patient completed SBRT to the liver on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60 Gy in 5 fractions.

**Recent Presentation:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased stoma output, with the last bowel movement one day prior. A CT scan of the abdomen showed small bowel dilation, fecalization, and air-fluid levels with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding, but without pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

**Management and Findings:**  
The patient was managed conservatively with NPO and IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast revealed increased small bowel diameter and a persistent transition point at the parastomal hernia level. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
- **Temperature:** 98.8 F (37.1 C)  
- **Pulse:** 108  
- **Respirations:** 18  
- **Blood Pressure:** 100/59  
- **Pulse Oximetry:** 93%  

**Laboratory Data:**  
- White Blood Cell Count: 11 -> 7.3

- Nasogastric tube output: 400 cc bilious  
- Urine output: Adequate  

**Consultation:**  
Discussed with Dr. Bilal \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Due to increasing bowel diameter and tachycardia, an urgent parastomal hernia repair (without mesh) was indicated.

**Plan:**  
- Perform ABG and cross-match  
- Arrange for urgent parastomal hernia repair

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**

---

**Code Status:** Full code  

**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  

**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  

**Active Problem:** Abdominal pain  

---

**Medical History:**  
- Diabetes Mellitus (DM)  
- ECOG Performance Status: 0-1  
- No known drug allergies  

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a case of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. Post sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, the procedure was complicated by an anastomotic leak and colo-cutaneous fistula, necessitating a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. There is no role for adjuvant chemotherapy as the window period has passed. The patient completed SBRT to the liver on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60 Gy in 5 fractions.

**Recent Presentation:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased stoma output, with the last bowel movement one day prior. A CT scan of the abdomen showed small bowel dilation, fecalization, and air-fluid levels with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding, but without pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

**Management and Findings:**  
The patient was managed conservatively with NPO and IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast revealed increased small bowel diameter and a persistent transition point at the parastomal hernia level. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
- **Temperature:** 98.8 F (37.1 C)  
- **Pulse:** 108  
- **Respirations:** 18  
- **Blood Pressure:** 100/59  
- **Pulse Oximetry:** 93%  

**Laboratory Data:**  
- White Blood Cell Count: 11 -> 7.3  
- Lactate: 2.8 -> 1.7  

**Interventions:**  
- IV fluids at 120 cc/hr  
- Nasogastric tube output: 400 cc bilious  
- Urine output: Adequate  

**Consultation:**  
Discussed with Dr. Bilal \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Due to increasing bowel diameter and tachycardia, an urgent parastomal hernia repair (without mesh) was indicated.

**Risks and Complications Explained:**  
Potential risks include leak, bleeding, hematoma, recurrence, with ACS risk scores indicating above-average risk for complications.

**Plan:**  
- Perform ABG and cross-match  
- Arrange for urgent parastomal hernia repair
