**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease. She is a non-smoker and is post-menopausal. Current medications include Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide.

**Pathology Findings:**  
- Left Breast Cancer: cT1N0  
- Right Breast Biopsy: Benign breast tissue  
- Left Breast Biopsy: Invasive breast carcinoma (NST II), ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2 negative by FISH, Ki67 5%  
- Left Axillary Biopsy: Metastatic  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound indicate an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm and a mass in the right breast measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm, along with a solitary left axillary lymph node showing prominent cortical thickening.  
- CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland and a bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst. There are no signs of distant metastasis.  
- Bone scan results are negative.

The case was reviewed at the multidisciplinary conference, where it was agreed to proceed with upfront surgery given the patient’s age and potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
- Left breast examination revealed a mass located at the 12 o’clock position measuring approximately 1.8 x 1.5 cm.

**Code Status:** Full Code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Ovarian Cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective Surgery  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  
The patient is a [REDACTED] years old married female with a history of vaginal deliveries. She reported back pain since February 2024, prompting evaluation by her gynecologist, where an ovarian cyst was identified. A planned operation was delayed, and a second opinion was sought, resulting in a CT scan that revealed a complex cystic mass in the left ovary. 

**Surgical History:**  
- Lipoma excision (head and neck area) - twice  
- D&C for miscarriage  

**Family History:**  
- Mother with skin cancer  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Soft lax abdomen  
- Ultrasound indicated a left complex ovarian mass  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** A 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass likely arising from the left ovary, showing features of malignancy with multiple papillary projections. The mass is in proximity to the bladder and right ovary, with no pelvic lymphadenopathy detected.  
- **CT Abdomen and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion likely from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder, with no significant lymphadenopathy or ascites. There is a hypoattenuating liver lesion measuring 1.3 cm, recommended for follow-up.  
- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastasis; findings suggest that the enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are likely inflammatory.

**Plan:**  
The surgical plan includes midline laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), omentectomy, and pelvic/para-aortic lymph node dissection. Risks of surgery, including intraoperative bleeding, organ injury, potential need for reoperation, wound complications, and thromboembolic events, were discussed with the patient, who consented to proceed. The surgery is scheduled for July 11, 2024. 

**Anesthesia:**  
General anesthesia will be administered.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  
The patient is a [REDACTED] years old married female with a history of vaginal deliveries. She reported back pain since February 2024, prompting evaluation by her gynecologist, where an ovarian cyst was identified. A planned operation was delayed, and a second opinion was sought, resulting in a CT scan that revealed a complex cystic mass in the left ovary. 

**Surgical History:**  
- Lipoma excision (head and neck area) - twice  
- D&C for miscarriage  

**Family History:**  
- Mother with skin cancer  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Soft lax abdomen  
- Ultrasound indicated a left complex ovarian mass  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** A 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass likely arising from the left ovary, showing features of malignancy with multiple papillary projections. The mass is in proximity to the bladder and right ovary, with no pelvic lymphadenopathy detected.  
- **CT Abdomen and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion likely from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder, with no significant lymphadenopathy or ascites. There is a hypoattenuating liver lesion measuring 1.3 cm, recommended for follow-up.  
- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastasis; findings suggest that the enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are likely inflammatory.

**Plan:**  
The surgical plan includes midline laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), omentectomy, and pelvic/para-aortic lymph node dissection. Risks of surgery, including intraoperative bleeding, organ injury, potential need for reoperation, wound complications, and thromboembolic events, were discussed with the patient, who consented to proceed. The surgery is scheduled for July 11, 2024. 

**Anesthesia:**  
General anesthesia will be administered.

**Family History:**  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Soft lax abdomen  
- Ultrasound indicated a left complex ovarian mass  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** A 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass likely arising from the left ovary, showing features of malignancy with multiple papillary projections. The mass is in proximity to the bladder and right ovary, with no pelvic lymphadenopathy detected.  
- **CT Abdomen and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion likely from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder, with no significant lymphadenopathy or ascites. There is a hypoattenuating liver lesion measuring 1.3 cm, recommended for follow-up.  
- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastasis; findings suggest that the enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are likely inflammatory.

She reported back pain since February 2024, prompting evaluation by her gynecologist, where an ovarian cyst was identified. A planned operation was delayed, and a second opinion was sought, resulting in a CT scan that revealed a complex cystic mass in the left ovary. 

**Surgical History:**  
- Lipoma excision (head and neck area) - twice  
- D&C for miscarriage  

**Family History:**  
- Mother with skin cancer  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Soft lax abdomen  
- Ultrasound indicated a left complex ovarian mass  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** A 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass likely arising from the left ovary, showing features of malignancy with multiple papillary projections. The mass is in proximity to the bladder and right ovary, with no pelvic lymphadenopathy detected.  
- **CT Abdomen and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion likely from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder, with no significant lymphadenopathy or ascites. There is a hypoattenuating liver lesion measuring 1.3 cm, recommended for follow-up.  
- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastasis; findings suggest that the enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are likely inflammatory.

**Plan:**  
The surgical plan includes midline laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), omentectomy, and pelvic/para-aortic lymph node dissection. Risks of surgery, including intraoperative bleeding, organ injury, potential need for reoperation, wound complications, and thromboembolic events, were discussed with the patient, who consented to proceed. The surgery is scheduled for July 11, 2024. 

**Anesthesia:**  
General anesthesia will be administered.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**

**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective Surgery  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  
The patient is a [REDACTED] years old married female with a history of vaginal deliveries. She reported back pain since February 2024, prompting evaluation by her gynecologist, where an ovarian cyst was identified. A planned operation was delayed, and a second opinion was sought, resulting in a CT scan that revealed a complex cystic mass in the left ovary. 

**Surgical History:**  
- Lipoma excision (head and neck area) - twice  
- D&C for miscarriage  

**Family History:**  
- Mother with skin cancer  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Soft lax abdomen  
- Ultrasound indicated a left complex ovarian mass  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** A 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass likely arising from the left ovary, showing features of malignancy with multiple papillary projections. The mass is in proximity to the bladder and right ovary, with no pelvic lymphadenopathy detected.  
- **CT Abdomen and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion likely from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder, with no significant lymphadenopathy or ascites. There is a hypoattenuating liver lesion measuring 1.3 cm, recommended for follow-up.  
- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastasis; findings suggest that the enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are likely inflammatory.

**Plan:**  
The surgical plan includes midline laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), omentectomy, and pelvic/para-aortic lymph node dissection. Risks of surgery, including intraoperative bleeding, organ injury, potential need for reoperation, wound complications, and thromboembolic events, were discussed with the patient, who consented to proceed. The surgery is scheduled for July 11, 2024. 

**Anesthesia:**  
General anesthesia will be administered.

SP adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen

 

 

brain mri : 

      There are two left temporal lesions, their close proximity 

to the CSF and 

associated diffusion

      restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic oedema raise 

the possibility 

of CNS lymphoma in

      addition to brain parenchymal metastases.

      There is no leptomeningeal metastasis.

 

brain mri :

Interval enlargement in previously seen to adjacent lesions in 

posterior left 

temporal lobe, with mild increase in surrounding oedema. The 

appearance is most 

suggestive of metastatic process versus multifocal 

glioma/glioblastoma. Please 

correlate with histopathology. Is there any contraindication for 

surgery/biopsy?

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  
The patient is a [Redacted] year old female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017. Treatment included neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by left modified radical mastectomy and adjuvant therapies. Recent imaging of the brain revealed two left temporal lesions, raising concerns for central nervous system lymphoma in addition to possible brain metastases. Follow-up imaging indicated interval enlargement of these lesions, suggesting a metastatic process or multifocal glioma/glioblastoma, warranting histopathological correlation.

**Procedures Applied During Hospitalization:**  
- Navigation Guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Important Developments During Hospitalization:**  
The patient was evaluated by the neurosurgery team and was observed to be conscious, alert, and oriented. There were no signs of respiratory distress, and the patient was tolerating a diet well. Chest physiotherapy was performed, and ambulation was encouraged. A new dressing was applied with minimal discharge noted. The patient's hypertension was addressed with the addition of amlodipine and candesartan to her medication regimen.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left temporal brain metastases vs. lymphoma  
**Admission Date:** June 25, 2024  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  
The patient is a [Redacted] year old female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017. Treatment included neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by left modified radical mastectomy and adjuvant therapies. Recent imaging of the brain revealed two left temporal lesions, raising concerns for central nervous system lymphoma in addition to possible brain metastases. Follow-up imaging indicated interval enlargement of these lesions, suggesting a metastatic process or multifocal glioma/glioblastoma, warranting histopathological correlation.

**Procedures Applied During Hospitalization:**  
- Navigation Guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Important Developments During Hospitalization:**  
The patient was evaluated by the neurosurgery team and was observed to be conscious, alert, and oriented. There were no signs of respiratory distress, and the patient was tolerating a diet well. Chest physiotherapy was performed, and ambulation was encouraged. The patient is deemed fit for discharge.

fat stranding.

No pneumoperitonium.

No free fluid.

 

 

The patient was admitted for conservative managemetn (NPO + IV fluid)

 

Follow up CT with oral contrast was requested today whioch revealed an 

increasing small bowel diameter (around 5.5 cm) with a persistrant transional 

point at the level of parastomal hernia. We were also infomred of a new terminal

 

ileal mass (Away from the transition point) that's of suspeciosu apperance.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus. He has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 and no known drug allergies.

The patient has a history of sigmoid colon cancer with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, which was complicated by an anastomotic leak and subsequent colostomy. A diverting transverse colostomy was performed on June 16, 2022. The patient has not received adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window. He completed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the liver on June 27, 2023.

The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and air-fluid levels measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding. No free fluid or pneumoperitoneum was observed.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including being NPO and receiving IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm, with a persistent transition point at the level of a parastomal hernia. Notably, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was also identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
[Omitted for brevity]

**Laboratory Results:**  
- White Blood Cell Count: Elevated  
- Lactate: Elevated  

The patient was placed on IV fluids at a rate of 120 cc/hr, with adequate output from the NG tube.  

The treatment plan was discussed with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], and given the increasing small bowel diameter and tachycardia, urgent surgical intervention without mesh repair was determined to be necessary. Risks associated with the procedure, including leakage, bleeding, hematoma, and recurrence, were thoroughly explained to the patient.

**ACS Risk Scores:**  
The patient’s scores indicated an above-average risk for serious complications, any complication, pneumonia, cardiac complications, surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, venous thromboembolism, renal failure, readmission, return to OR, death, discharge to a nursing or rehab facility, and sepsis.

**Plan:**  
- Obtain arterial blood gas and cross-match  
- Arrange for urgent parastomal hernia repair  

---

**Procedures Conducted During Hospitalization:**  
- Exploration laparotomy  

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient had a smooth recovery following the procedure.

He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, which was complicated by an anastomotic leak and subsequent colostomy. A diverting transverse colostomy was performed on June 16, 2022. The patient has not received adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window. He completed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the liver on June 27, 2023.

The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and air-fluid levels measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding. No free fluid or pneumoperitoneum was observed.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including being NPO and receiving IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm, with a persistent transition point at the level of a parastomal hernia. Notably, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was also identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
[Omitted for brevity]

**Laboratory Results:**  
- White Blood Cell Count: Elevated  
- Lactate: Elevated  

The patient was placed on IV fluids at a rate of 120 cc/hr, with adequate output from the NG tube.  

The treatment plan was discussed with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], and given the increasing small bowel diameter and tachycardia, urgent surgical intervention without mesh repair was determined to be necessary. Risks associated with the procedure, including leakage, bleeding, hematoma, and recurrence, were thoroughly explained to the patient.

**ACS Risk Scores:**  
The patient’s scores indicated an above-average risk for serious complications, any complication, pneumonia, cardiac complications, surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, venous thromboembolism, renal failure, readmission, return to OR, death, discharge to a nursing or rehab facility, and sepsis.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient has a history of sigmoid colon cancer with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, which was complicated by an anastomotic leak and subsequent colostomy. A diverting transverse colostomy was performed on June 16, 2022. The patient has not received adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window. He completed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the liver on June 27, 2023.

The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and air-fluid levels measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding. No free fluid or pneumoperitoneum was observed.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including being NPO and receiving IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm, with a persistent transition point at the level of a parastomal hernia. Notably, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was also identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
[Omitted for brevity]

**Laboratory Results:**  
- White Blood Cell Count: Elevated  
- Lactate: Elevated  

The patient was placed on IV fluids at a rate of 120 cc/hr, with adequate output from the NG tube.  

The treatment plan was discussed with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], and given the increasing small bowel diameter and tachycardia, urgent surgical intervention without mesh repair was determined to be necessary. Risks associated with the procedure, including leakage, bleeding, hematoma, and recurrence, were thoroughly explained to the patient.

**ACS Risk Scores:**  
The patient’s scores indicated an above-average risk for serious complications, any complication, pneumonia, cardiac complications, surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, venous thromboembolism, renal failure, readmission, return to OR, death, discharge to a nursing or rehab facility, and sepsis.

**Plan:**  
- Obtain arterial blood gas and cross-match  
- Arrange for urgent parastomal hernia repair  

---

**Procedures Conducted During Hospitalization:**  
- Exploration laparotomy  

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient had a smooth recovery following the procedure.

**Clinical Summary:**  
He has no known drug allergies. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, which was complicated by an anastomotic leak and subsequent colostomy. The patient has not received adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window. He completed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the liver on June 27, 2023.

The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and air-fluid levels measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding. No free fluid or pneumoperitoneum was observed.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including being NPO and receiving IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm, with a persistent transition point at the level of a parastomal hernia. Notably, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was also identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
[Omitted for brevity]

**Laboratory Results:**

The patient has not received adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window. He completed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the liver on June 27, 2023.

The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and air-fluid levels measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding. No free fluid or pneumoperitoneum was observed.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including being NPO and receiving IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm, with a persistent transition point at the level of a parastomal hernia. Notably, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was also identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
[Omitted for brevity]

**Laboratory Results:**

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus. He has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 and no known drug allergies.

The patient has a history of sigmoid colon cancer with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, which was complicated by an anastomotic leak and subsequent colostomy. A diverting transverse colostomy was performed on June 16, 2022. The patient has not received adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window. He completed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the liver on June 27, 2023.

The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and air-fluid levels measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding. No free fluid or pneumoperitoneum was observed.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including being NPO and receiving IV fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm, with a persistent transition point at the level of a parastomal hernia. Notably, a new terminal ileal mass of suspicious appearance was also identified.

**Vital Signs:**  
[Omitted for brevity]

**Laboratory Results:**  
- White Blood Cell Count: Elevated  
- Lactate: Elevated  

The patient was placed on IV fluids at a rate of 120 cc/hr, with adequate output from the NG tube.  

The treatment plan was discussed with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], and given the increasing small bowel diameter and tachycardia, urgent surgical intervention without mesh repair was determined to be necessary. Risks associated with the procedure, including leakage, bleeding, hematoma, and recurrence, were thoroughly explained to the patient.

**ACS Risk Scores:**  
The patient’s scores indicated an above-average risk for serious complications, any complication, pneumonia, cardiac complications, surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, venous thromboembolism, renal failure, readmission, return to OR, death, discharge to a nursing or rehab facility, and sepsis.

**Plan:**  
- Obtain arterial blood gas and cross-match  
- Arrange for urgent parastomal hernia repair  

---

**Procedures Conducted During Hospitalization:**  
- Exploration laparotomy  

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient had a smooth recovery following the procedure.
