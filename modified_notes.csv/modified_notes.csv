Current medications include Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide (Concor PLUS)® 5/12.5 mg once daily. Genetic testing returned negative results.  

**Diagnosis:**  
- Left Breast Cancer: cT1N0  
- Right breast biopsy: Benign breast tissue  
- Left breast biopsy: Invasive breast carcinoma, no special type, Grade II, ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, Ki67 5%  
- Left axillary biopsy: Metastatic  

**Imaging Findings:**  
Mammogram and breast ultrasound revealed:

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left breast cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a [Patient Age]-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease (no stent). She is a non-smoker and is post-menopausal.  

Current medications include Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide (Concor PLUS)® 5/12.5 mg once daily. Genetic testing returned negative results.  

**Diagnosis:**  
- Left Breast Cancer: cT1N0  
- Right breast biopsy: Benign breast tissue  
- Left breast biopsy: Invasive breast carcinoma, no special type, Grade II, ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, Ki67 5%  
- Left axillary biopsy: Metastatic  

**Imaging Findings:**  
Mammogram and breast ultrasound revealed:
- Left breast: Irregular mass measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
- Right breast: Mass measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm, with additional cystic structures noted.  
- Solitary left axillary lymph node demonstrating a prominent cortex.  

CT imaging of the abdomen indicated nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, requiring follow-up. There is also a bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst, warranting gynecologic evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was noted. A bone scan was negative.  

The case was reviewed during a multidisciplinary conference, where it was determined that upfront surgery was indicated due to the patient's age and potential for oncotype testing post-operatively.  

**Physical Examination:**  
On examination, a mass was palpated in the left breast, located at the 12 o'clock position, measuring approximately 1.8 x 1.5 cm, situated close to the skin.  

---

**Procedures Performed During Hospitalization:**  
- Left total wide local excision with axillary dissection.  

---

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient has been stable throughout the hospitalization, with effective pain management. A drain is in place with approximately 60 cc of serosanguinous output. The surgical wound is covered with a clean dressing.  

---

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Breast cancer  
**Discharge Date:** July 1, 2024  
**Discharge Type:** Elective Discharge  

**Discharge Medications:** No outpatient medications were identified for discharge.  

**Pending Test Results:** Histopathology  

---

**Patient Condition Upon Discharge:**  
- Glasgow Coma Scale: 15  
- Performance Status: Full active  
- Pain Scale: 1  

---

**Follow-Up Plan Instructions:**  
The patient is scheduled for follow-up with the surgical oncology clinic, Dr. [Surgeon's Name], on July 10, 2024.  

**Dietary Recommendations:** Regular diet.  

**When to Seek Urgent Care:**  
- Shortness of breath  
- Altered level of consciousness  
- Uncontrolled pain  
- Fever exceeding 38.0°C  
- Uncontrolled side effects from chemotherapy or radiotherapy (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)  
- Post-operative complications (e.g., discharge from the surgical site)  

**How to Obtain Urgent Care:**  
During working hours (8 AM - 4 PM, Sunday to Thursday), contact the call center at [+**********5300460]. For assistance after hours, the patient may visit the emergency room for adults and pediatrics.

**Additional Details:**  
- **Allergies:** No known drug allergies were reported.  
- **Consultations:** A gynecologic consultation has been requested for evaluation of the large left ovarian cyst.  
- **Lifestyle Modifications:** The patient was counseled on the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity post-recovery.

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a [Patient Age]-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease (no stent). She is a non-smoker and is post-menopausal.  

Current medications include Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide (Concor PLUS)® 5/12.5 mg once daily. Genetic testing returned negative results.  

**Diagnosis:**  
- Left Breast Cancer: cT1N0  
- Right breast biopsy: Benign breast tissue  
- Left breast biopsy: Invasive breast carcinoma, no special type, Grade II, ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, Ki67 5%  
- Left axillary biopsy: Metastatic  

**Imaging Findings:**  
Mammogram and breast ultrasound revealed:
- Left breast: Irregular mass measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
- Right breast: Mass measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm, with additional cystic structures noted.  

CT imaging of the abdomen indicated nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, requiring follow-up. A bone scan was negative.  

The case was reviewed during a multidisciplinary conference, where it was determined that upfront surgery was indicated due to the patient's age and potential for oncotype testing post-operatively.
