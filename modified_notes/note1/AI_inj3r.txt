**UROLOGY ER CONSULT**

**Patient Information:**
49-year-old female with a history of unmanaged asthma and significant familial medical history. 

**Oncology History:**
- Left breast cancer (T3N0, IDC G3) treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x 4, Taxotere x 2, weekly paclitaxel) followed by left wide local excision and adjuvant therapy in December 2017. 
- Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered postoperatively.
- Patient began tamoxifen after undergoing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in October 2018.
- History of right breast cancer (T1N0, IDC G3) treated with right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in January 2020.
- On Femara since February 2020; subsequent follow-up revealed abnormal right axillary lymph nodes, confirmed through biopsy.
- Underwent completion right axillary dissection in July 2021, with ten out of twenty lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma.
- Received adjuvant capecitabine, which was discontinued due to toxicity.
- Treatment included adjuvant external beam radiation therapy to the right chest wall, axilla, and supraclavicular fossa.
- Progression noted to bone, with subsequent management involving faslodex and ribociclib, with dosages adjusted for adverse effects.
- Recent imaging indicated stable bone metastasis with no new developments.

**Presenting Complaint:**
Patient presented to the ER with a one-month history of progressive, intermittent right-sided abdominal pain, which is relieved by defecation. The patient reports significant constipation, managing bowel movements approximately once every four days, with the last bowel motion occurring earlier today. There is no associated dysuria, frequency, or urgency, although the patient experiences flank pain, especially upon voiding. 

**Physical Examination:**
- Abdomen soft, non-distended, and non-tender.
- Tenderness noted in the right costophrenic angle.

**Imaging Findings:**
CT imaging revealed right-sided hydrouretronephrosis.

**Laboratory Findings:**
- No evidence of infection or significant abnormalities noted in recent laboratory tests.

**Plan:**
- Initiate right nephrostomy insertion via interventional radiology.
- Address acute kidney injury (AKI) as indicated.

**Additional Relevant Details:**
1. **Patient's Condition at Discharge:** Patient remains stable with no acute distress noted. Pain is managed with analgesics. 
2. **Medications at Discharge:** Continue current oncology regimen, including tamoxifen and Femara, while monitoring for any potential interactions with new medications initiated for pain management.
3. **Follow-Up Care:** Schedule follow-up appointment with oncology within one week to reassess cancer management post-nephrostomy and to monitor kidney function and overall health status.

The case has been discussed with the on-call fellow for further management and intervention.
