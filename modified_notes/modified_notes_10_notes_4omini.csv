**Summary:**  
The patient is a **********-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.

**Clinical Findings:**  
- **Left Breast Cancer:** Clinical stage cT1N0.  
- **Biopsy Results:**  
  - Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
  - Left breast biopsy confirmed invasive breast carcinoma (not otherwise specified) with the following receptor status: ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, Ki67 at 5%.  
  - Left axillary biopsy showed metastatic involvement.  

- **Imaging Studies:**  
  - Mammography and breast ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
Notable findings included a 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass located at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, close to the skin.

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left breast cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery  

---

**Summary:**  
The patient is a **********-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal. The patient has a history of diabetes, which is currently well-controlled.

**Clinical Findings:**  
- **Left Breast Cancer:** Clinical stage cT1N0.  
- **Biopsy Results:**  
  - Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
  - Left breast biopsy confirmed invasive breast carcinoma (not otherwise specified) with the following receptor status: ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, Ki67 at 5%.  
  - Left axillary biopsy showed metastatic involvement.  

- **Imaging Studies:**  
  - Mammography and breast ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
Notable findings included a 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass located at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, close to the skin.

---

**Procedures Performed:**  
- Left total wide local excision with axillary dissection (LT WLE with AD).

  - Mammography and breast ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Summary:**  
The patient is a **********-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.

**Clinical Findings:**  
- **Left Breast Cancer:** Clinical stage cT1N0.  
- **Biopsy Results:**  
  - Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
  - Left breast biopsy confirmed invasive breast carcinoma (not otherwise specified) with the following receptor status: ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, Ki67 at 5%.  
  - Left axillary biopsy showed metastatic involvement.  

- **Imaging Studies:**  
  - Mammography and breast ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
Notable findings included a 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass located at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, close to the skin.

---

**Procedures Performed:**  
- Left total wide local excision with axillary dissection (LT WLE with AD).

  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
Notable findings included a 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass located at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, close to the skin.

---

**Procedures Performed:**  
- Left total wide local excision with axillary dissection (LT WLE with AD).

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old married female, Para [Redacted], with a history of all vaginal deliveries. The last menstrual period was on May 21, 2024.  

**Surgical History:**  
- Lipoma excision (head and neck area) twice  
- D&C for miscarriage  

**Family History:**  
- Mother with a history of skin cancer  

The patient reported experiencing back pain since February 2024, prompting an evaluation by her gynecologist, where an ovarian cyst was discovered. An operation was initially planned but subsequently delayed. A second opinion was sought from Dr. [Redacted], and a CT scan revealed a complex cystic mass in the ovary.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Soft, lax abdomen  
- Ultrasound indicated a complex ovarian mass  

**Radiology Findings:**  
A pelvic MRI performed on May 13, 2024, revealed a 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass likely arising from the left ovary, characterized by unilocular hemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with multiple papillary projections. The mass abuts the bladder dome and right ovary, with no evidence of pelvic lymphadenopathy. Endometrial thickening was also noted.  

A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed:  
- Multiple bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes  
- A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion likely from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder  
- A hypoattenuating liver lesion measuring 1.3 cm, which requires follow-up  

A PET scan indicated no definitive distant metastasis, with the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes likely being inflammatory.  

**Plan:**  
The surgical plan includes midline laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), omentectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection.  

**Risks discussed with the patient included:**

**Significant Findings from History and Examination:**  
The patient reported experiencing back pain since February 2024, prompting an evaluation by her gynecologist, where an ovarian cyst was discovered. An operation was initially planned but subsequently delayed. A second opinion was sought from Dr. [Redacted], and a CT scan revealed a complex cystic mass in the ovary.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Soft, lax abdomen  
- Ultrasound indicated a complex ovarian mass  

**Radiology Findings:**  
A pelvic MRI performed on May 13, 2024, revealed a 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass likely arising from the left ovary, characterized by unilocular hemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with multiple papillary projections. The mass abuts the bladder dome and right ovary, with no evidence of pelvic lymphadenopathy. Endometrial thickening was also noted.

**Significant Findings from History and Examination:**  
The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old married female, Para [Redacted], with a history of all vaginal deliveries. The last menstrual period was on May 21, 2024.  

**Surgical History:**  
- Lipoma excision (head and neck area) twice  
- D&C for miscarriage  

**Family History:**  
- Mother with a history of skin cancer  

The patient reported experiencing back pain since February 2024, prompting an evaluation by her gynecologist, where an ovarian cyst was discovered. An operation was initially planned but subsequently delayed. A second opinion was sought from Dr. [Redacted], and a CT scan revealed a complex cystic mass in the ovary.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Soft, lax abdomen  
- Ultrasound indicated a complex ovarian mass  

**Radiology Findings:**  
A pelvic MRI performed on May 13, 2024, revealed a 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass likely arising from the left ovary, characterized by unilocular hemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with multiple papillary projections. The mass abuts the bladder dome and right ovary, with no evidence of pelvic lymphadenopathy. Endometrial thickening was also noted.  

A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed:  
- Multiple bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes  
- A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion likely from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder  
- A hypoattenuating liver lesion measuring 1.3 cm, which requires follow-up  

A PET scan indicated no definitive distant metastasis, with the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes likely being inflammatory.  

**Plan:**  
The surgical plan includes midline laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), omentectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection.  

**Risks discussed with the patient included:**  
- Intraoperative bleeding and potential need for transfusion  
- Injury to abdominal organs  
- Possibility of reoperation due to postoperative complications  
- Wound complications  
- Thromboembolic events  

The patient consented to proceed with surgery, scheduled for July 11, 2024.

**Active Issues:**

1. **Acute Renal Shutdown**  
   - Baseline creatinine levels have shown a progressive increase.  
   - The patient was anuric.  
   - Renal ultrasound was unremarkable.  
   - The patient received intravenous fluids at a rate of 100 mL/hour.  

   **Plan:**  
   - Hemodialysis not indicated.  
   - Fluid rate to be decreased to 40 cc/hour.  

2. **Agitation**  
   - Hyperactive delirium secondary to renal shutdown.  
   - Initially uncontrolled with haloperidol, but subsequently managed with:  
     - Chlorpromazine 12.5 mg TID  
     - Chlorpromazine 25 mg Q 6 hours PRN  
     - Midazolam 2 mg PRN Q 4 hours as a second-line agent  

3. **Pain Management**  
   - Chronic pain, characterized by heaviness, numbness, and throbbing, exacerbated by movement and eating.  
   - Polyarthralgia and rib pain due to rib fracture.  
   - Right upper quadrant abdominal pain, possibly related to gallbladder stones.  
   - Patient previously on gabapentin, tramadol, and buscopan.  
   - Currently receiving intravenous fentanyl PRN.  

   **Plan:**  
   - Discontinue oral medications due to altered consciousness.

**Active Issues:**

1. **Acute Renal Shutdown**  
   - Baseline creatinine levels have shown a progressive increase.  
   - The patient was anuric.  
   - Renal ultrasound was unremarkable.  
   - The patient received intravenous fluids at a rate of 100 mL/hour.  

   **Plan:**  
   - Hemodialysis not indicated.  
   - Fluid rate to be decreased to 40 cc/hour.  

2. **Agitation**  
   - Hyperactive delirium secondary to renal shutdown.  
   - Initially uncontrolled with haloperidol, but subsequently managed with:  
     - Chlorpromazine 12.5 mg TID  
     - Chlorpromazine 25 mg Q 6 hours PRN  
     - Midazolam 2 mg PRN Q 4 hours as a second-line agent

SP neoadjuvant chemotherapy: AC x4 + Taxotere/herceptin x4

SP left MRM + AD on 1.10.2017

HP no residual carcinoma, 1/9 LNs, ypT0N1 

SP adjuvant EBRT to left CW and SCF as 50Gy/25Fx completed on 

30.1.2018

SP adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen

 

 

brain mri : 

      There are two left temporal lesions, their close proximity 

to the CSF and 

associated diffusion

      restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic oedema raise 

the possibility 

of CNS lymphoma in

      addition to brain parenchymal metastases.

      There is no leptomeningeal metastasis.

 

brain mri :

Interval enlargement in previously seen to adjacent lesions in 

posterior left 

temporal lobe, with mild increase in surrounding oedema. The 

appearance is most 

suggestive of metastatic process versus multifocal 

glioma/glioblastoma. Please 

correlate with histopathology. Is there any contraindication for 

surgery/biopsy?

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left temporal brain metastases vs. lymphoma  
**Admission Date:** June 25, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery - Navigation Guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017. Treatment included neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC x4 and Taxotere/Herceptin x4, followed by left modified radical mastectomy on January 10, 2017, with no residual carcinoma noted on histopathology. The patient underwent adjuvant external beam radiation therapy to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completing treatment on January 30, 2018, and was subsequently treated with Herceptin and Tamoxifen.

Recent brain MRI findings indicated the presence of two left temporal lesions, with characteristics suggesting the possibility of CNS lymphoma or brain parenchymal metastases. There was interval enlargement of previously noted lesions, raising concerns for a metastatic process or multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. A decision was made to proceed with navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy.

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left temporal brain metastases vs. lymphoma  
**Admission Date:** June 25, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery - Navigation Guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017. Treatment included neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC x4 and Taxotere/Herceptin x4, followed by left modified radical mastectomy on January 10, 2017, with no residual carcinoma noted on histopathology. The patient underwent adjuvant external beam radiation therapy to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completing treatment on January 30, 2018, and was subsequently treated with Herceptin and Tamoxifen.

Recent brain MRI findings indicated the presence of two left temporal lesions, with characteristics suggesting the possibility of CNS lymphoma or brain parenchymal metastases. There was interval enlargement of previously noted lesions, raising concerns for a metastatic process or multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. A decision was made to proceed with navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Patient Overview:**  
The patient is a [Redacted] year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus. He has an ECOG Performance Status of 0-1 and has no known drug allergies.

**Oncology History:**  
The patient has a history of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, with the pathology indicating pT3N2bMx. The surgical course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and the development of a colostomy, which necessitated a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. The multidisciplinary care team decided against adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window.

**Radiation Therapy:**  
The patient received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60Gy delivered over 5 fractions.

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted a day prior.

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CAP CT of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and an air-fluid level measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding. No pneumoperitoneum or free fluid was observed. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm and a persistent transition point at the parastomal hernia. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, located away from the transition point.

**Clinical Status:**  
The patient was managed conservatively with NPO status and IV fluids. Vital signs indicated tachycardia, and laboratory results showed leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels. The patient was appropriately hydrated with IV fluids, and output from the NG tube was bilious.

**Surgical Decision:**  
After consultation with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], the decision was made for urgent surgical intervention to repair the parastomal hernia without mesh placement due to the increasing bowel diameter and the patient's hemodynamic status.

**Surgical Risks Discussed:**  
The patient was informed of the risks associated with the procedure, including potential complications such as leakage, bleeding, hematoma formation, and recurrence of the obstruction.

**ACS Risk Scores:**  
- Serious Complications: 24.3%

Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, located away from the transition point.

**Clinical Status:**  
The patient was managed conservatively with NPO status and IV fluids. Vital signs indicated tachycardia, and laboratory results showed leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels. The patient was appropriately hydrated with IV fluids, and output from the NG tube was bilious.

**Surgical Decision:**  
After consultation with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], the decision was made for urgent surgical intervention to repair the parastomal hernia without mesh placement due to the increasing bowel diameter and the patient's hemodynamic status.

**Patient Overview:**  
The patient is a [Redacted] year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus. He has an ECOG Performance Status of 0-1 and has no known drug allergies. The patient enjoys gardening and reading novels in his free time. The patient prefers to eat Italian cuisine and dislikes spicy food.

**Oncology History:**  
The patient has a history of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, with the pathology indicating pT3N2bMx. The surgical course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and the development of a colostomy, which necessitated a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. The multidisciplinary care team decided against adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window.

**Radiation Therapy:**  
The patient received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60Gy delivered over 5 fractions.

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted a day prior.

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CAP CT of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and an air-fluid level measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding. No pneumoperitoneum or free fluid was observed. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm and a persistent transition point at the parastomal hernia. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, located away from the transition point.

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Patient Overview:**  
The patient is a [Redacted] year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus. He has an ECOG Performance Status of 0-1 and has no known drug allergies.

**Radiation Therapy:**  
The patient received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60Gy delivered over 5 fractions.

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted a day prior.

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CAP CT of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and an air-fluid level measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding. No pneumoperitoneum or free fluid was observed. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm and a persistent transition point at the parastomal hernia. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, located away from the transition point.

**Clinical Status:**  
The patient was managed conservatively with NPO status and IV fluids. Vital signs indicated tachycardia, and laboratory results showed leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels. The patient was appropriately hydrated with IV fluids, and output from the NG tube was bilious.

**Surgical Decision:**  
After consultation with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], the decision was made for urgent surgical intervention to repair the parastomal hernia without mesh placement due to the increasing bowel diameter and the patient's hemodynamic status.

**Surgical Risks Discussed:**  
The patient was informed of the risks associated with the procedure, including potential complications such as leakage, bleeding, hematoma formation, and recurrence of the obstruction.

**Plan:**  
- Order arterial blood gas analysis and crossmatch.  
- Arrange for urgent parastomal hernia repair.

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Patient Overview:**  
The patient is a [Redacted] year-old male with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus. He has an ECOG Performance Status of 0-1 and has no known drug allergies.

**Oncology History:**  
The patient has a history of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, with the pathology indicating pT3N2bMx. The surgical course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and the development of a colostomy, which necessitated a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. The multidisciplinary care team decided against adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window.

**Radiation Therapy:**  
The patient received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60Gy delivered over 5 fractions.

**Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted a day prior.

**Imaging Findings:**  
A CAP CT of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation with fecalization and an air-fluid level measuring up to 4.5 cm, along with mild bowel wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding. No pneumoperitoneum or free fluid was observed. A follow-up CT with oral contrast indicated an increased small bowel diameter of approximately 5.5 cm and a persistent transition point at the parastomal hernia. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, located away from the transition point.

**Clinical Status:**  
The patient was managed conservatively with NPO status and IV fluids. Vital signs indicated tachycardia, and laboratory results showed leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels. The patient was appropriately hydrated with IV fluids, and output from the NG tube was bilious.

**Surgical Decision:**  
After consultation with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], the decision was made for urgent surgical intervention to repair the parastomal hernia without mesh placement due to the increasing bowel diameter and the patient's hemodynamic status.

**Surgical Risks Discussed:**  
The patient was informed of the risks associated with the procedure, including potential complications such as leakage, bleeding, hematoma formation, and recurrence of the obstruction.

**ACS Risk Scores:**  
- Serious Complications: 24.3%  
- Any Complication: 35.9%  
- Pneumonia: 3.2%  
- Cardiac Complications: 2.1%  
- Surgical Site Infection: 17.6%  
- Urinary Tract Infection: 2.6%  
- Venous Thromboembolism: 1.4%  
- Renal Failure: 1.7%  
- Readmission: 23.3%  
- Return to OR: 9.7%  
- Death: 4.2%  
- Discharge to Nursing or Rehab Facility: 19.3%  
- Sepsis: 4.9%  

**Plan:**  
- Order arterial blood gas analysis and crossmatch.  
- Arrange for urgent parastomal hernia repair.  

---

**Procedures During Hospitalization:**  
- Exploration laparotomy  

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient had a smooth postoperative course.
