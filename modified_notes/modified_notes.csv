**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left breast cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery  

---

**Summary:**  
The patient is a **********-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.

**Clinical Findings:**  
- **Left Breast Cancer:** Clinical stage cT1N0.  
- **Biopsy Results:**  
  - Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
  - Left breast biopsy confirmed invasive breast carcinoma (not otherwise specified) with the following receptor status: ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, Ki67 at 5%.  
  - Left axillary biopsy showed metastatic involvement.  

- **Imaging Studies:**  
  - Mammography and breast ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
Notable findings included a 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass located at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, close to the skin.

---

**Procedures Performed:**  
- Left total wide local excision with axillary dissection (LT WLE with AD).

---

**Post-operative Course:**  
The patient is stable, demonstrating effective pain control. A surgical drain is in place with serosanguineous output. The wound is covered with clean dressing.

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left breast cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery  

---

**Summary:**  
The patient is a **********-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal. The patient has a history of diabetes, which is currently well-controlled.

**Clinical Findings:**  
- **Left Breast Cancer:** Clinical stage cT1N0.  
- **Biopsy Results:**  
  - Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
  - Left breast biopsy confirmed invasive breast carcinoma (not otherwise specified) with the following receptor status: ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, Ki67 at 5%.  
  - Left axillary biopsy showed metastatic involvement.  

- **Imaging Studies:**  
  - Mammography and breast ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
Notable findings included a 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass located at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, close to the skin.

---

**Procedures Performed:**  
- Left total wide local excision with axillary dissection (LT WLE with AD).

---

**Post-operative Course:**  
The patient is stable, demonstrating effective pain control. A surgical drain is in place with serosanguineous output. The wound is covered with clean dressing.

  - Mammography and breast ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
Notable findings included a 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass located at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, close to the skin.

**Summary:**  
The patient is a **********-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.

**Clinical Findings:**  
- **Left Breast Cancer:** Clinical stage cT1N0.  
- **Biopsy Results:**  
  - Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
  - Left breast biopsy confirmed invasive breast carcinoma (not otherwise specified) with the following receptor status: ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, Ki67 at 5%.  
  - Left axillary biopsy showed metastatic involvement.  

- **Imaging Studies:**  
  - Mammography and breast ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
Notable findings included a 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass located at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, close to the skin.

---

**Procedures Performed:**  
- Left total wide local excision with axillary dissection (LT WLE with AD).

---

**Post-operative Course:**  
The patient is stable, demonstrating effective pain control. A surgical drain is in place with serosanguineous output. The wound is covered with clean dressing.

- **Imaging Studies:**  
  - Mammography and breast ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex.  
  - Right breast imaging revealed a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm with additional cystic formations.  
  - A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited prominent cortical thickening.  
  - CT scan noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland requiring follow-up, along with a bulky uterus and large left ovarian cyst for further gynecological evaluation. No definitive distant metastasis was identified.  
  - Bone scan results were negative.  

The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference, resulting in a consensus to proceed with upfront surgery due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype diagnostics post-operatively.

**Examination Findings:**  
Notable findings included a 1.8 x 1.5 cm mass located at the 12 o'clock position of the left breast, close to the skin.
