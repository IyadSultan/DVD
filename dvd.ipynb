She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC * 4 + Taxotere * 2, which she could not tolerate, and weekly paclitaxel). She had left wide local excision (WLE) with axillary dissection (T2N1mi) in December 2017, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. She was initially on Tamoxifen and underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) in October 2018.  \n",
      "- **Right Breast:** History of right breast cancer, T1N0, IDC Grade 3, ER 95%, PR 30%, HER2NEU-negative. She underwent a right mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBX), T1cN0 (0/5), in January 2020. She was started on Femara (Letrozole) in February 2020.  \n",
      "  In May 2021, during follow-up, an abnormal right axillary lymph node biopsy was positive for malignancy. Restaging revealed no additional disease. She underwent completion of right axillary dissection on July 13, 2021, with pathology showing metastatic carcinoma in 10 out of 20 lymph nodes. She received 6 cycles of adjuvant Xeloda, which was discontinued due to toxicity from paresthesia. Faslodex was declined by the pharmacy, as it was not indicated at this stage. Adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was administered to the right chest wall, axilla, and supraclavicular fossa as 40Gy/15fx.  \n",
      "  She was placed back on Tamoxifen after a response was noted in the lymph nodes in January 2020. She later developed bone metastases and was treated with Faslodex, LHRH agonist, and Ribociclib in July 2022. The Ribociclib dose was reduced to 400mg due to constipation. A CT scan in November 2022 showed more dense sclerosis of metastatic bony deposits, suggestive of treatment response, without evidence of local or distant recurrence. A baseline bone scan from November 2022 showed two lesions.  \n",
