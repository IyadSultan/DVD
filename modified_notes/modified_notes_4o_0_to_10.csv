      Review MRI performed in an outside institution on 13 May 

2024 and 

submitted for official reading.  The 

interpretation is dependent on the quality and number of 

available sequences. 

Pelvic MRI without IV contrast: 

There is a 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass in the lower 

abdomen/pelvis, probably 

arising from left ovary.  The tumour 

consists of unilocular haemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with 

numerous papillary 

projections measuring up to 1.2 

cm. The tumour is abutting the bladder dome and right ovary. 

There are a few 

right ovarian follicles measuring up 

to 2 cm. No pelvic lymphadenopathy.   The uterus is 

retroflexed.  There is 

endometrial thickening measuring 2.2 

cm. No cervical mass. No destructive bone lesion. 

 

Impression: There is a 13 cm Complex cystic pelvic mass 

probably arising from 

left ovary with malignant 

features (papillary projections measuring up to 1.2 cm.

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Ovarian Carcinoma  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective Surgery  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old married female with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries. Last menstrual period was on May 21, 2024. Surgical history includes lipoma excisions in the head and neck area and dilation and curettage for miscarriage. Family history is significant for maternal skin cancer.

The patient reported back pain beginning in February 2024, prompting medical evaluation by her gynecologist, which led to the discovery of an ovarian cyst. A second opinion and subsequent CT scan revealed an ovarian complex cystic mass.

**Examination:**

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old married female with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries. Last menstrual period was on May 21, 2024. Surgical history includes lipoma excisions in the head and neck area and dilation and curettage for miscarriage. Family history is significant for maternal skin cancer.

The patient reported back pain beginning in February 2024, prompting medical evaluation by her gynecologist, which led to the discovery of an ovarian cyst. A second opinion and subsequent CT scan revealed an ovarian complex cystic mass.

**Examination:**
- Abdomen: Soft and lax
- Ultrasound: Left complex ovarian mass
- CA-125: 135 U/mL

**Imaging Findings:**

- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** Identified a 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass in the lower abdomen/pelvis, likely originating from the left ovary. Features include unilocular hemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with papillary projections up to 1.2 cm. The mass abuts the bladder dome and right ovary. No pelvic lymphadenopathy. The uterus is retroflexed with endometrial thickening of 2.2 cm. No cervical mass or destructive bone lesions.

- **CT Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder. No ascites or significant lymphadenopathy. Liver shows a 1.3 cm hypoattenuating lesion requiring follow-up. Multiple bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes up to 1 cm in short axis. No lung consolidation or effusions.

- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastases. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes likely inflammatory.

**Plan:**

- Scheduled midline laparotomy
- Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection

**Risks Discussed:**

- Intraoperative bleeding and potential need for transfusion
- Abdominal organ injury
- Possible redo surgery for postoperative bleeding or organ injury
- Wound complications
- Thromboembolic events

The patient consented to proceed, with surgery scheduled for July 11, 2024.

**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective Surgery  
**Reason for Hospitalization:** The patient was hospitalized for surgery to address ovarian carcinoma identified through imaging studies.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old married female with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries. Last menstrual period was on May 21, 2024. Surgical history includes lipoma excisions in the head and neck area and dilation and curettage for miscarriage. Family history is significant for maternal skin cancer.

The patient reported back pain beginning in February 2024, prompting medical evaluation by her gynecologist, which led to the discovery of an ovarian cyst. A second opinion and subsequent CT scan revealed an ovarian complex cystic mass.

**Examination:**
- Abdomen: Soft and lax
- Ultrasound: Left complex ovarian mass
- CA-125: 135 U/mL

**Important Abnormal Lab Results:** CA-125 level was elevated at 135 U/mL, indicating ovarian pathology.

**Imaging Findings:**

- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** Identified a 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass in the lower abdomen/pelvis, likely originating from the left ovary. Features include unilocular hemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with papillary projections up to 1.2 cm. The mass abuts the bladder dome and right ovary. No pelvic lymphadenopathy. The uterus is retroflexed with endometrial thickening of 2.2 cm. No cervical mass or destructive bone lesions.

- **CT Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder. No ascites or significant lymphadenopathy. Liver shows a 1.3 cm hypoattenuating lesion requiring follow-up. Multiple bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes up to 1 cm in short axis. No lung consolidation or effusions.

- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastases. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes likely inflammatory.

**Imaging Studies:** Key imaging studies included a pelvic MRI, CT scan, and PET scan, which provided detailed insights into the ovarian mass and ruled out distant metastases.

**Plan:**

- Scheduled midline laparotomy
- Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection

**Risks Discussed:**

- Intraoperative bleeding and potential need for transfusion
- Abdominal organ injury
- Possible redo surgery for postoperative bleeding or organ injury
- Wound complications
- Thromboembolic events

The patient consented to proceed, with surgery scheduled for July 11, 2024.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old married female with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries. Last menstrual period was on May 21, 2024. Surgical history includes lipoma excisions in the head and neck area and dilation and curettage for miscarriage. Family history is significant for maternal skin cancer.

The patient reported back pain beginning in February 2024, prompting medical evaluation by her gynecologist, which led to the discovery of an ovarian cyst. A second opinion and subsequent CT scan revealed an ovarian complex cystic mass.

The patient has two cats and a dog at home.

**Examination:**
- Abdomen: Soft and lax
- Ultrasound: Left complex ovarian mass
- CA-125: 135 U/mL

**Imaging Findings:**

- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** Identified a 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass in the lower abdomen/pelvis, likely originating from the left ovary. Features include unilocular hemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with papillary projections up to 1.2 cm. The mass abuts the bladder dome and right ovary. No pelvic lymphadenopathy. The uterus is retroflexed with endometrial thickening of 2.2 cm. No cervical mass or destructive bone lesions.

- **CT Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder. No ascites or significant lymphadenopathy. Liver shows a 1.3 cm hypoattenuating lesion requiring follow-up. Multiple bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes up to 1 cm in short axis. No lung consolidation or effusions.

- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastases. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes likely inflammatory.

**Plan:**

- Scheduled midline laparotomy
- Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection

**Risks Discussed:**

- Intraoperative bleeding and potential need for transfusion
- Abdominal organ injury
- Possible redo surgery for postoperative bleeding or organ injury
- Wound complications
- Thromboembolic events

The patient consented to proceed, with surgery scheduled for July 11, 2024.

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**

The patient reported back pain beginning in February 2024, prompting medical evaluation by her gynecologist, which led to the discovery of an ovarian cyst. A second opinion and subsequent CT scan revealed an ovarian complex cystic mass.

**Examination:**
- Abdomen: Soft and lax
- Ultrasound: Left complex ovarian mass
- CA-125: 135 U/mL

**Imaging Findings:**

- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** Identified a 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass in the lower abdomen/pelvis, likely originating from the left ovary. Features include unilocular hemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with papillary projections up to 1.2 cm. The mass abuts the bladder dome and right ovary. No pelvic lymphadenopathy. The uterus is retroflexed with endometrial thickening of 2.2 cm. No cervical mass or destructive bone lesions.

- **CT Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder. No ascites or significant lymphadenopathy. Liver shows a 1.3 cm hypoattenuating lesion requiring follow-up. No lung consolidation or effusions.

- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastases. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes likely inflammatory.

**Plan:**

- Scheduled midline laparotomy
- Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection

**Risks Discussed:**

- Intraoperative bleeding and potential need for transfusion
- Abdominal organ injury
- Possible redo surgery for postoperative bleeding or organ injury
- Wound complications
- Thromboembolic events

The patient consented to proceed, with surgery scheduled for July 11, 2024.

- Abdomen: Soft and lax
- Ultrasound: Left complex ovarian mass
- CA-125: 135 U/mL

**Imaging Findings:**

- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):** Identified a 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass in the lower abdomen/pelvis, likely originating from the left ovary. Features include unilocular hemorrhagic/proteinaceous fluid with papillary projections up to 1.2 cm. The mass abuts the bladder dome and right ovary. No pelvic lymphadenopathy. The uterus is retroflexed with endometrial thickening of 2.2 cm. No cervical mass or destructive bone lesions.

- **CT Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis:** A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion from the left ovary compressing the urinary bladder. No ascites or significant lymphadenopathy. Liver shows a 1.3 cm hypoattenuating lesion requiring follow-up. Multiple bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes up to 1 cm in short axis. No lung consolidation or effusions.

- **PET Scan:** No definitive distant metastases. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes likely inflammatory.

**Plan:**

- Scheduled midline laparotomy
- Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection

**Risks Discussed:**

- Intraoperative bleeding and potential need for transfusion

Significant Findings from History and Examination:

Assessment and Plan:

[Redacted] year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary hypertension. She has metastatic breast cancer with liver involvement and is under palliative care.

Hospital course involved management of acute renal shutdown, hyperactive delirium, chronic pain, and respiratory secretions.

History of Presenting Illness:

The patient was referred to the emergency room due to elevated creatinine levels reported by home care. Two days prior, she became drowsy and agitated at home with decreased oral intake and reduced urine output. She reported no vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, or shortness of breath. She developed new-onset dysarthria without headache or abnormal movements.

Active Issues:

1. Acute Renal Shutdown:
   - Progressive increase in creatinine levels from baseline to 4.9 mg/dL
   - Patient anuric
   - Renal ultrasound unremarkable
   - Initially on IV fluids at 100ml/hour

   Plan:
   - Hemodialysis not indicated
   - Reduce IV fluid rate to 40ml/hour

2. Agitation:
   - Hyperactive delirium secondary to renal shutdown
   - Uncontrolled on Haloperidol
   - Stabilized with:
     - Chlorpromazine 12.5mg TID
     - Chlorpromazine 25mg Q6H PRN
     - Midazolam 2mg PRN Q4H, second-line after chlorpromazine

3. Pain Management:
   - Chronic pain (> 6 months) characterized by heaviness, numbness, and throbbing
   - Aggravated by movement and eating, with polyarthralgia and rib pain at fracture site
   - Abdominal pain, possibly related to gallbladder stones
   - Previously on Gabatrex 300mg BID, Panda 500mg TID, Buscopan 1 tab TID
   - Administered Fentanyl IV PRN 10mcg Q1H

   Plan:
   - Discontinue oral medications due to unconscious state

4. Depression:
   - Previously on Venlafaxine 75mg daily, Lorazepam 0.5mg PRN

   Plan:
   - Hold medications as the patient is unable to swallow

Active Issues:

1. Acute Renal Shutdown:
   - Progressive increase in creatinine levels from baseline to 4.9 mg/dL
   - Patient anuric
   - Initially on IV fluids at 100ml/hour

   Plan:
   - Hemodialysis not indicated
   - Reduce IV fluid rate to 40ml/hour

2. Agitation:
   - Hyperactive delirium secondary to renal shutdown
   - Uncontrolled on Haloperidol
   - Stabilized with:
     - Chlorpromazine 12.5mg TID
     - Chlorpromazine 25mg Q6H PRN
     - Midazolam 2mg PRN Q4H, second-line after chlorpromazine

3. Pain Management:
   - Chronic pain (> 6 months) characterized by heaviness, numbness, and throbbing
   - Aggravated by movement and eating, with polyarthralgia and rib pain at fracture site
   - Abdominal pain, possibly related to gallbladder stones
   - Previously on Gabatrex 300mg BID, Panda 500mg TID, Buscopan 1 tab TID
   - Administered Fentanyl IV PRN 10mcg Q1H

SP adjuvant EBRT to left CW and SCF as 50Gy/25Fx completed on 

30.1.2018

SP adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen

 

 

brain mri : 

      There are two left temporal lesions, their close proximity 

to the CSF and 

associated diffusion

      restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic oedema raise 

the possibility 

of CNS lymphoma in

      addition to brain parenchymal metastases.

      There is no leptomeningeal metastasis.

 

brain mri :

Interval enlargement in previously seen to adjacent lesions in 

posterior left 

temporal lobe, with mild increase in surrounding oedema. The 

appearance is most 

suggestive of metastatic process versus multifocal 

glioma/glioblastoma. Please 

correlate with histopathology. Is there any contraindication for 

surgery/biopsy?

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  

The patient, a female, was diagnosed with left breast cancer in April 2017, characterized as ER-negative, PR-positive (60%), and HER2-positive. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by a left modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017. Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes affected, classified as ypT0N1. She received adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa (50Gy/25Fx), completed on January 30, 2018, along with adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen.  

**Brain MRI Findings:**  
- Two left temporal lesions were identified, with associated diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggestive of CNS lymphoma or brain parenchymal metastases. No leptomeningeal metastasis was noted.  
- Interval enlargement of lesions in the posterior left temporal lobe with mild increase in surrounding edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. Histopathological correlation is recommended.  

**Elective Admission:** For navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy.  

**Significant Laboratory and Radiology Findings:** None

**Important Developments During Hospitalization:**  

The neurosurgery team assessed the patient, noting she was well, conscious, alert, and oriented to time, place, and person. She exhibited no signs of respiratory distress and tolerated her diet well. Chest physiotherapy was performed, and ambulation was encouraged. A new dressing was applied, showing no erythema and minimal wound discharge. Dr. [REDACTED] was consulted regarding elevated blood pressure readings, resulting in the addition of Amlodipine 5 mg BID and Candesartan 16 mg BID.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Head and Neck: No pallor, jaundice, or cervical lymphadenopathy.  
- Respiratory: Bilateral vesicular breath sounds without added sounds.  
- Cardiovascular: Normal cardiac sounds with no rubs, murmurs, or gallops; no jugular venous distension or bilateral lower limb edema.  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no rigidity or rebound tenderness.  
- Neurological: Conscious, alert, oriented, GCS 15/15, moves all limbs freely, interactive.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  

The patient, a female, was diagnosed with left breast cancer in April 2017, characterized as ER-negative, PR-positive (60%), and HER2-positive. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by a left modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017. Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes affected, classified as ypT0N1. She received adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa (50Gy/25Fx), completed on January 30, 2018, along with adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen.  

**Brain MRI Findings:**  
- Two left temporal lesions were identified, with associated diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggestive of CNS lymphoma or brain parenchymal metastases. No leptomeningeal metastasis was noted.  
- Interval enlargement of lesions in the posterior left temporal lobe with mild increase in surrounding edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. Histopathological correlation is recommended.  

Imaging Studies: MRI revealed two left temporal lesions with associated diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema.

**Elective Admission:** For navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy.  

**Significant Laboratory and Radiology Findings:** None

**Important Developments During Hospitalization:**  

The neurosurgery team assessed the patient, noting she was well, conscious, alert, and oriented to time, place, and person. She exhibited no signs of respiratory distress and tolerated her diet well. Chest physiotherapy was performed, and ambulation was encouraged. A new dressing was applied, showing no erythema and minimal wound discharge. Dr. [REDACTED] was consulted regarding elevated blood pressure readings, resulting in the addition of Amlodipine 5 mg BID and Candesartan 16 mg BID.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Head and Neck: No pallor, jaundice, or cervical lymphadenopathy.  
- Respiratory: Bilateral vesicular breath sounds without added sounds.  
- Cardiovascular: Normal cardiac sounds with no rubs, murmurs, or gallops; no jugular venous distension or bilateral lower limb edema.  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no rigidity or rebound tenderness.  
- Neurological: Conscious, alert, oriented, GCS 15/15, moves all limbs freely, interactive.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  

The patient, a female, was diagnosed with left breast cancer in April 2017, characterized as ER-negative, PR-positive (60%), and HER2-positive. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by a left modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017. Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes affected, classified as ypT0N1. She received adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa (50Gy/25Fx), completed on January 30, 2018, along with adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen.  

**Brain MRI Findings:**  
- Two left temporal lesions were identified, with associated diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggestive of CNS lymphoma or brain parenchymal metastases. No leptomeningeal metastasis was noted.  
- Interval enlargement of lesions in the posterior left temporal lobe with mild increase in surrounding edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. Histopathological correlation is recommended.

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left temporal brain metastases vs. lymphoma  
**Admission Date:** June 25, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery - Navigation-guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  

The patient, a female, was diagnosed with left breast cancer in April 2017, characterized as ER-negative, PR-positive (60%), and HER2-positive. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by a left modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with axillary dissection on October 1, 2017. Histopathology showed no residual carcinoma with 1 out of 9 lymph nodes affected, classified as ypT0N1. She received adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa (50Gy/25Fx), completed on January 30, 2018, along with adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen.  
The patient enjoys bird watching and knitting during her free time.

**Brain MRI Findings:**  
- Two left temporal lesions were identified, with associated diffusion restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic edema, suggestive of CNS lymphoma or brain parenchymal metastases. No leptomeningeal metastasis was noted.  
- Interval enlargement of lesions in the posterior left temporal lobe with mild increase in surrounding edema, suggestive of a metastatic process versus multifocal glioma/glioblastoma. Histopathological correlation is recommended.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**

---

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Patient History:**  
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus. ECOG performance status is 0-1. No known drug allergies.

**Clinical Assessment:**  
The patient has a history of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, which was complicated by an anastomotic leak and colo-cutaneous fistula. A diverting transverse colostomy was performed on June 16, 2022. The patient has undergone SBRT to the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a dose of 60Gy/5Fx.

**Recent Presentation:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased stoma output, with the last bowel movement occurring one day prior. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilatation, fecalization, and air-fluid level, with a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm. There was mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding, without pneumoperitoneum or free fluid. A follow-up CT scan confirmed the presence of a persistent transitional point at the parastomal hernia level and a suspicious terminal ileal mass.

**Management and Findings:**  
The patient was admitted for conservative management involving nil per os (NPO) and intravenous fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast showed increased small bowel diameter (approximately 5.5 cm) and a persistent transitional point at the parastomal hernia level, along with a suspicious terminal ileal mass. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring due to his history of severe abdominal issues.

**Vital Signs and Labs:**  
The patient exhibited tachycardia. White blood cell count and lactate levels improved from initial elevated values. 

**Intervention and Surgical Plan:**  
After discussion with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], an urgent parastomal hernia repair was deemed necessary. The procedure entailed the risks of leak, bleeding, hematoma, and recurrence, which were communicated to the patient.

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Patient History:**  
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus. ECOG performance status is 0-1. No known drug allergies.

**Clinical Assessment:**  
The patient has a history of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, which was complicated by an anastomotic leak and colo-cutaneous fistula. A diverting transverse colostomy was performed on June 16, 2022. The patient has undergone SBRT to the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a dose of 60Gy/5Fx.

**Recent Presentation:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased stoma output, with the last bowel movement occurring one day prior. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilatation, fecalization, and air-fluid level, with a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm. There was mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding, without pneumoperitoneum or free fluid. A follow-up CT scan confirmed the presence of a persistent transitional point at the parastomal hernia level and a suspicious terminal ileal mass.

**Management and Findings:**  
The patient was admitted for conservative management involving nil per os (NPO) and intravenous fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast showed increased small bowel diameter (approximately 5.5 cm) and a persistent transitional point at the parastomal hernia level, along with a suspicious terminal ileal mass. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring due to his history of severe abdominal issues.

**Vital Signs and Labs:**  
The patient exhibited tachycardia. White blood cell count and lactate levels improved from initial elevated values. The patient's blood pressure was noted to be hypotensive post-operatively but stabilized before discharge.

**Intervention and Surgical Plan:**  
After discussion with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], an urgent parastomal hernia repair was deemed necessary. The procedure entailed the risks of leak, bleeding, hematoma, and recurrence, which were communicated to the patient. The patient was counseled on the risks of the surgical procedure, including leak, bleeding, hematoma, and recurrence.

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Patient History:**  
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus. ECOG performance status is 0-1. No known drug allergies.

**Clinical Assessment:**  

**Recent Presentation:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased stoma output, with the last bowel movement occurring one day prior. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilatation, fecalization, and air-fluid level, with a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm. There was mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding, without pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

**Management and Findings:**  
The patient was admitted for conservative management involving nil per os (NPO) and intravenous fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast showed increased small bowel diameter (approximately 5.5 cm) and a persistent transitional point at the parastomal hernia level, along with a suspicious terminal ileal mass.

**Vital Signs and Labs:**  
The patient exhibited tachycardia. White blood cell count and lactate levels improved from initial elevated values. 

**Intervention and Surgical Plan:**  
After discussion with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], an urgent parastomal hernia repair was deemed necessary. The procedure entailed the risks of leak, bleeding, hematoma, and recurrence, which were communicated to the patient.

**Patient History:**  
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus. ECOG performance status is 0-1. No known drug allergies.

**Clinical Assessment:**  
The patient has a history of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, which was complicated by an anastomotic leak and colo-cutaneous fistula. A diverting transverse colostomy was performed on June 16, 2022. The patient has undergone SBRT to the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a dose of 60Gy/5Fx.

**Recent Presentation:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased stoma output, with the last bowel movement occurring one day prior. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilatation, fecalization, and air-fluid level, with a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm. There was mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding, without pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

**Management and Findings:**  
The patient was admitted for conservative management involving nil per os (NPO) and intravenous fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast showed increased small bowel diameter (approximately 5.5 cm) and a persistent transitional point at the parastomal hernia level, along with a suspicious terminal ileal mass.

**Vital Signs and Labs:**  
The patient exhibited tachycardia. White blood cell count and lactate levels improved from initial elevated values.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**

---

**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Patient History:**  
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus. ECOG performance status is 0-1. No known drug allergies.

**Clinical Assessment:**  
The patient has a history of sigmoid carcinoma with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. He underwent an urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022, which was complicated by an anastomotic leak and colo-cutaneous fistula. A diverting transverse colostomy was performed on June 16, 2022. The patient has undergone SBRT to the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a dose of 60Gy/5Fx.

**Recent Presentation:**  
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased stoma output, with the last bowel movement occurring one day prior. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilatation, fecalization, and air-fluid level, with a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm. There was mild bowel wall thickening and fat stranding, without pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

**Management and Findings:**  
The patient was admitted for conservative management involving nil per os (NPO) and intravenous fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast showed increased small bowel diameter (approximately 5.5 cm) and a persistent transitional point at the parastomal hernia level, along with a suspicious terminal ileal mass.

**Vital Signs and Labs:**  
The patient exhibited tachycardia. White blood cell count and lactate levels improved from initial elevated values. 

**Intervention and Surgical Plan:**  
After discussion with Dr. Bilal [Redacted], an urgent parastomal hernia repair was deemed necessary. The procedure entailed the risks of leak, bleeding, hematoma, and recurrence, which were communicated to the patient.

**ACS Risk Assessment:**  
- Serious Complication: 24.3%  
- Any Complication: 35.9%  
- Pneumonia: 3.2%
