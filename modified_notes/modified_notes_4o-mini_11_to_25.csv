**Hospital Course Summary:**

The patient, a [REDACTED]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, was admitted for elective surgery due to a diagnosis of left breast cancer (cT2N+M0). Genetic testing revealed variants of uncertain significance in ATM and PALB2.

Imaging studies, including ultrasound and mammography, showed a subareolar mass in the left breast measuring 2.7 x 2 x 2.1 cm, as well as multiple irregular masses, suggesting multicentric disease. Pathology confirmed invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, grade 2, with estrogen receptor positivity (90%), progesterone receptor positivity (50%), and HER-2/neu negativity. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC followed by T, with the last cycle on May 23, 2024. Restaging imaging indicated a decrease in the size of left breast lesions and axillary lymph nodes, although a new 7 mm nodule was noted in the right lower lobe, necessitating short-term follow-up.

**Procedures Performed:**
- Left Mastectomy
- Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Same as admission diagnosis.

**Significant Laboratory Findings:** Awaiting histopathology results.

**Imaging Studies:** Restaging mammogram and breast ultrasound showing decreased size of lesions.

The patient, a [REDACTED]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, was admitted for elective surgery due to a diagnosis of left breast cancer (cT2N+M0). Genetic testing revealed variants of uncertain significance in ATM and PALB2.

Imaging studies, including ultrasound and mammography, showed a subareolar mass in the left breast measuring 2.7 x 2 x 2.1 cm, as well as multiple irregular masses, suggesting multicentric disease. Pathology confirmed invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, grade 2, with estrogen receptor positivity (90%), progesterone receptor positivity (50%), and HER-2/neu negativity. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC followed by T, with the last cycle on May 23, 2024. Restaging imaging indicated a decrease in the size of left breast lesions and axillary lymph nodes, although a new 7 mm nodule was noted in the right lower lobe, necessitating short-term follow-up.

**Procedures Performed:**
- Left Mastectomy
- Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Same as admission diagnosis.

**Significant Laboratory Findings:** Awaiting histopathology results.

**Imaging Studies:** Restaging mammogram and breast ultrasound showing decreased size of lesions.

**Reason for Hospitalization:** Elective surgery for left breast cancer.

---

**Hospital Course Summary:**

The patient, a [REDACTED]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, was admitted for elective surgery due to a diagnosis of left breast cancer (cT2N+M0). 

Imaging studies, including ultrasound and mammography, showed a subareolar mass in the left breast measuring 2.7 x 2 x 2.1 cm, as well as multiple irregular masses, suggesting multicentric disease. Pathology confirmed invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, grade 2, with estrogen receptor positivity (90%), progesterone receptor positivity (50%), and HER-2/neu negativity. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC followed by T, with the last cycle on May 23, 2024. 

**Procedures Performed:**
- Left Mastectomy
- Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Same as admission diagnosis.

**Significant Laboratory Findings:** Awaiting histopathology results.

**Imaging Studies:** Restaging mammogram and breast ultrasound showing decreased size of lesions.

- Pulse: 75 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 17 breaths/min
- Blood Pressure: 101/63 mmHg (noted hypotension)
- Pulse Oximetry: 98%

**Patient's Condition at Discharge:**
- Glasgow Coma Scale: 15/15
- Performance Status: 0 (Fully Active)
- Pain Scale: 0 (No pain reported)

**Medications at Discharge:**
1. Paracetamol 500 mg: Take 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as needed.

The patient, a [REDACTED]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, was admitted for elective surgery due to a diagnosis of left breast cancer (cT2N+M0).

Imaging studies, including ultrasound and mammography, showed a subareolar mass in the left breast measuring 2.7 x 2 x 2.1 cm, as well as multiple irregular masses, suggesting multicentric disease. Pathology confirmed invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, grade 2, with estrogen receptor positivity (90%), progesterone receptor positivity (50%), and HER-2/neu negativity. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC followed by T, with the last cycle on May 23, 2024.

**Procedures Performed:**
- Left Mastectomy
- Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Same as admission diagnosis.

**Significant Laboratory Findings:** 

**Imaging Studies:** Restaging mammogram and breast ultrasound showing decreased size of lesions.

The patient, a female with a medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, was admitted for elective surgery due to a diagnosis of left breast cancer (cT2N+M0). Genetic testing revealed variants of uncertain significance in ATM and PALB2.

Imaging studies, including ultrasound and mammography, showed a subareolar mass in the left breast measuring 2.7 x 2 x 2.1 cm, as well as multiple irregular masses, suggesting multicentric disease. Pathology confirmed invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, grade 2, with estrogen receptor positivity (90%), progesterone receptor positivity (50%), and HER-2/neu negativity. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC followed by T, with the last cycle on May 23, 2024. Restaging imaging indicated a decrease in the size of left breast lesions and axillary lymph nodes, although a new 7 mm nodule was noted in the right lower lobe, necessitating short-term follow-up.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam/Important Developments During Hospitalization:**

The patient is a ********** year old female with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She is a non-smoker with no known drug allergies. She presents with a new diagnosis of stage IV pancreatic body/tail cancer (TNM staging: T3 N2 M1), with metastases to lymph nodes, lung, and liver.

Her clinical history began two months prior, marked by epigastric pain, persistent nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and significant weight loss (from 58 kg to 54 kg over the past year). An endoscopy on November 19, 2023, was reported as normal. An abdominal ultrasound on the same date revealed multiple liver lesions, the largest of which measured 10.1 x 8.6 x 6.8 cm, likely representing metastases. Additionally, a 3.4 x 4.4 x 2.8 cm hypoechoic lesion near the porta hepatis was noted, possibly an enlarged lymph node.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed on December 13, 2023, showed:
- A soft tissue mass in the body and tail of the pancreas measuring 4.6 x 2.6 cm, compressing the pancreatic vein and encasing the pancreatic artery.
- Multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the peripancreatic, para-coeliac, aortocaval, and retrocaval regions, some measuring up to 2.5 cm in short axis.
- Multiple metastatic liver lesions, with some measuring up to 8 cm.
- Small pulmonary nodules and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.

Currently, the patient reports epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, managed with tramadol, and associated with nausea but no vomiting or changes in bowel habits. There are no reports of fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower limb swelling. 

The patient was admitted for a liver biopsy, which was performed via interventional radiology. Post-procedure, she experienced mild pain, which was managed with IV paracetamol. She was discharged with pain medications.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam/Important Developments During Hospitalization:**

The patient is a ********** year old female with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She is a non-smoker with no known drug allergies. She presents with a new diagnosis of stage IV pancreatic body/tail cancer (TNM staging: T3 N2 M1), with metastases to lymph nodes, lung, and liver.

Her clinical history began two months prior, marked by epigastric pain, persistent nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and significant weight loss (from 58 kg to 54 kg over the past year). An endoscopy on November 19, 2023, was reported as normal. An abdominal ultrasound on the same date revealed multiple liver lesions, the largest of which measured 10.1 x 8.6 x 6.8 cm, likely representing metastases. Additionally, a 3.4 x 4.4 x 2.8 cm hypoechoic lesion near the porta hepatis was noted, possibly an enlarged lymph node.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed on December 13, 2023, showed:
- A soft tissue mass in the body and tail of the pancreas measuring 4.6 x 2.6 cm, compressing the pancreatic vein and encasing the pancreatic artery.
- Multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the peripancreatic, para-coeliac, aortocaval, and retrocaval regions, some measuring up to 2.5 cm in short axis.
- Multiple metastatic liver lesions, with some measuring up to 8 cm.
- Small pulmonary nodules and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.

Currently, the patient reports epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, managed with tramadol, and associated with nausea but no vomiting or changes in bowel habits. There are no reports of fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower limb swelling. 

The patient was admitted for a liver biopsy, which was performed via interventional radiology. Post-procedure, she experienced mild pain, which was managed with IV paracetamol. She was discharged with pain medications.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam/Important Developments During Hospitalization:**

The patient is a ********** year old female with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She is a non-smoker with no known drug allergies. She presents with a new diagnosis of stage IV pancreatic body/tail cancer (TNM staging: T3 N2 M1), with metastases to lymph nodes, lung, and liver.

Her clinical history began two months prior, marked by epigastric pain, persistent nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and significant weight loss (from 58 kg to 54 kg over the past year). An endoscopy on November 19, 2023, was reported as normal. An abdominal ultrasound on the same date revealed multiple liver lesions, the largest of which measured 10.1 x 8.6 x 6.8 cm, likely representing metastases. Additionally, a 3.4 x 4.4 x 2.8 cm hypoechoic lesion near the porta hepatis was noted, possibly an enlarged lymph node.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed on December 13, 2023, showed:
- A soft tissue mass in the body and tail of the pancreas measuring 4.6 x 2.6 cm, compressing the pancreatic vein and encasing the pancreatic artery.
- Multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the peripancreatic, para-coeliac, aortocaval, and retrocaval regions, some measuring up to 2.5 cm in short axis.
- Multiple metastatic liver lesions, with some measuring up to 8 cm.
- Small pulmonary nodules and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.

Currently, the patient reports epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, managed with tramadol, and associated with nausea but no vomiting or changes in bowel habits. There are no reports of fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower limb swelling. 

The patient was admitted for a liver biopsy, which was performed via interventional radiology. Post-procedure, she experienced mild pain, which was managed with IV paracetamol. She was discharged with pain medications.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam/Important Developments During Hospitalization:**

She presents with a new diagnosis of stage IV pancreatic body/tail cancer (TNM staging: T3 N2 M1), with metastases to lymph nodes, lung, and liver.

Her clinical history began two months prior, marked by epigastric pain, persistent nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and significant weight loss (from 58 kg to 54 kg over the past year). An endoscopy on November 19, 2023, was reported as normal. An abdominal ultrasound on the same date revealed multiple liver lesions, the largest of which measured 10.1 x 8.6 x 6.8 cm, likely representing metastases. Additionally, a 3.4 x 4.4 x 2.8 cm hypoechoic lesion near the porta hepatis was noted, possibly an enlarged lymph node.

Currently, the patient reports epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, managed with tramadol, and associated with nausea but no vomiting or changes in bowel habits. There are no reports of fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower limb swelling. 

The patient was admitted for a liver biopsy, which was performed via interventional radiology. Post-procedure, she experienced mild pain, which was managed with IV paracetamol. She was discharged with pain medications.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam/Important Developments During Hospitalization:**

She presents with a new diagnosis of stage IV pancreatic body/tail cancer (TNM staging: T3 N2 M1), with metastases to lymph nodes, lung, and liver.

Her clinical history began two months prior, marked by epigastric pain, persistent nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and significant weight loss (from 58 kg to 54 kg over the past year). An endoscopy on November 19, 2023, was reported as normal. An abdominal ultrasound on the same date revealed multiple liver lesions, the largest of which measured 10.1 x 8.6 x 6.8 cm, likely representing metastases. Additionally, a 3.4 x 4.4 x 2.8 cm hypoechoic lesion near the porta hepatis was noted, possibly an enlarged lymph node.

Currently, the patient reports epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, managed with tramadol, and associated with nausea but no vomiting or changes in bowel habits. There are no reports of fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower limb swelling. 

The patient was admitted for a liver biopsy, which was performed via interventional radiology. She was discharged with pain medications.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam/Important Developments During Hospitalization:**

The patient is a ********** year old female with a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She is a non-smoker with no known drug allergies. She presents with a new diagnosis of stage IV pancreatic body/tail cancer (TNM staging: T3 N2 M1), with metastases to lymph nodes, lung, and liver.

Her clinical history began two months prior, marked by epigastric pain, persistent nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and significant weight loss (from 58 kg to 54 kg over the past year). An endoscopy on November 19, 2023, was reported as normal. An abdominal ultrasound on the same date revealed multiple liver lesions, the largest of which measured 10.1 x 8.6 x 6.8 cm, likely representing metastases. Additionally, a 3.4 x 4.4 x 2.8 cm hypoechoic lesion near the porta hepatis was noted, possibly an enlarged lymph node.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed on December 13, 2023, showed:
- A soft tissue mass in the body and tail of the pancreas measuring 4.6 x 2.6 cm, compressing the pancreatic vein and encasing the pancreatic artery.
- Multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the peripancreatic, para-coeliac, aortocaval, and retrocaval regions, some measuring up to 2.5 cm in short axis.
- Multiple metastatic liver lesions, with some measuring up to 8 cm.
- Small pulmonary nodules and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.

Currently, the patient reports epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, managed with tramadol, and associated with nausea but no vomiting or changes in bowel habits. There are no reports of fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or lower limb swelling. 

The patient was admitted for a liver biopsy, which was performed via interventional radiology. Post-procedure, she experienced mild pain, which was managed with IV paracetamol. She was discharged with pain medications.

-Admitted for pain crisis on 1/1

 

********** was admitted on 1/1

He presented to the ER with generalized pain - mostly lower limbs (pain crisis) 

He was already on:

MIR 10mg, MST 60mg,  fentaNYL PATCH  25 mcg/hr at home

 

In the ER, he was given perfelgan, and morphine 5mg IV twice 

Pain was still not controlled. 

 

Vitals taken in the ER showed decrease O2 saturation 80%, pulse reaching 150's

He was put on face mask 6L, chest x ray was requested - showed perihilar 

infiltrates. 

 

Labs on admission showed: 

CBC - hemoglobin 10.8, platelets 317, reticulocytes 8.1%

Hemolytic workeup done - haptoglobin <10, LDH 2002, total bilirubin/direct 

bilirubin = 1.58/0.72, coombs test ( direct and indirect ) positive, 

monospecific coombs test +4 IgG.

 

Admitted for pain management.

 

He spiked a fever on the same day of admission 39.1 c 

Septic workeup was done and repeated

CBC - hemoglobin 9.8, reticulocytes 9%, total bilirubin/direct bilirubin 

1.54/0.54

He stayed tachypnic ( while on face mask 6L, so he was put on vapotherm, on 

auscultation he had decreased basilar bilateral airway entry )

 

ICU were consulted:

Dr.**********n was informed about his condition 

Plan: - Manage pain 

      - Start supportive vapotherm --> he was started on vapotherm FiO2 40, Flow

 

        rate 20 

 

Dr.**********an **********taab was informed about his generalized pain condition 

pain team plan : - start ketamine 0.1mg/kg/hr

                 - increase fentanyl by PCA to 175/175 - gradually increased

                 - make paracetramol regualar 

                 - give hydrocortison stress dose 

                 - re-assess after changes & inform dr.**********an 

 

He was started on meropenem, vancomycin, zomax, tamiflu as a case of chest 

infection

 

-Respiratory:

Patient was on vapotherm FiO2 40, Flow rate 20 on 1/1

Today, on 3/1, his respiratory status was improved, so he was weaned to face 

mask 10L after assesement by the respiratory team , his o2 saturation on face 

mask 10L was 99%

 

-Infectious wise:

Today, he was afebrile day 2 

On meropenem, vancomycin, zomax, tamiflu day 3

 

-Pain wise:

Generalized Pain was improved and controlled on:

-FCI 175/175mcg via PCA

-ketamine 0.1mg/kg/hr.

-ibuprofen 160MG*3.

-gaba 300MG*2.

-paracetamol prn 

 

Pain team assesement today -> 

The patient's bony pain is controlled ,he moves his lower limbs with mild pain .

 

-Hematology wise:

Hemoglobin stable on 8.2 since 2 days 

Reticulocytes trending down from 12 to 9.4

Total/direct bilirubin 1.1/0.4

 

**During morning round today, patient was seen, he was interactive, pain was 

controlled - he reported decreased pain , respiratory status - on face mask 10L,

 

O2 saturation normal.

Respiratory auscultation - same findings as yesterday - decreased bilateral 

airway entry basilary. 

Pain team also assesed him - patient's bony pain is controlled ,he moves his 

lower limbs with mild pain. 

 

He was planned to be given IVIG for 2 days 

And to start on clexane prophylaxis BID 

 

TODAYS EVENT :

==============

I was called by the nurse due to decreased o2 saturation 50% upon examination

Father was not present at the time. 

Patient was already on face mask 10L 

Patient was unresponsive, gasping, weak pulses. 

 

Code blue announced; ICU team, pediatric team, nurses were bedside

CPR team action : 

Given naloxone, assumed opioid overdosem did not revert 

Intra-osseus and external jugular cannula were secured for medications.

He was given epinephrine 4 times, on the first two doses his heartbeat would 

return momentarily before he went into PEA then asystole. 

Later on there was neither response on the epinephrine doses nor on epinephrine 

infusion.

He recieved two doses of bicarbonate and a dose of calcium gluconate 

with no response. 

Glucocheck twice were above 100 mg/dl and was given 500ml Normal saline IV 

bolus. 

Pupils were initially fixed mid-dilated then later became fixed full dilated.

 

Total of 15 cycles of CPR were done with asystole in all cycles. 

 

The father was updated more than once about his condition till we stopped CPR. 

 

ECG was done  - asystole

No peripheral pulses found, no breathing sounds, pupils fixed dilated 

 

Patient was announced dead at 3/1/2024, 13:05 pm

                            DEATH NOTE 

=========================================================================

 

-**********, a ********** year old male patient, diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia

-He is on mycophenolate mofetil 

-Admitted for pain crisis on 1/1

 

********** was admitted on 1/1

He presented to the ER with generalized pain - mostly lower limbs (pain crisis) 

He was already on:

MIR 10mg, MST 60mg,  fentaNYL PATCH  25 mcg/hr at home

 

In the ER, he was given perfelgan, and morphine 5mg IV twice 

Pain was still not controlled.
Vitals taken in the ER showed decrease O2 saturation 80%, pulse reaching 150's

He was put on face mask 6L, chest x ray was requested - showed perihilar 

infiltrates.
Labs on admission showed: 

CBC - hemoglobin 10.
8, platelets 317, reticulocytes 8.
1%

Hemolytic workeup done - haptoglobin <10, LDH 2002, total bilirubin/direct 

bilirubin = 1.
58/0.
72, coombs test ( direct and indirect ) positive, 

monospecific coombs test +4 IgG.
Admitted for pain management.
He spiked a fever on the same day of admission 39.
1 c 

Septic workeup was done and repeated

CBC - hemoglobin 9.
8, reticulocytes 9%, total bilirubin/direct bilirubin 

1.
54/0.
54

He stayed tachypnic ( while on face mask 6L, so he was put on vapotherm, on 

auscultation he had decreased basilar bilateral airway entry )

 

ICU were consulted:

Dr.
**********n was informed about his condition 

Plan: - Manage pain 

      - Start supportive vapotherm --> he was started on vapotherm FiO2 40, Flow

 

        rate 20 

 

Dr.
**********an **********taab was informed about his generalized pain condition 

pain team plan : - start ketamine 0.
1mg/kg/hr

                 - increase fentanyl by PCA to 175/175 - gradually increased

                 - make paracetramol regualar 

                 - give hydrocortison stress dose 

                 - re-assess after changes & inform dr.
**********an 

 

He was started on meropenem, vancomycin, zomax, tamiflu as a case of chest 

infection

 

-Respiratory:

Patient was on vapotherm FiO2 40, Flow rate 20 on 1/1

Today, on 3/1, his respiratory status was improved, so he was weaned to face 

mask 10L after assesement by the respiratory team , his o2 saturation on face 

mask 10L was 99%

 

-Infectious wise:

Today, he was afebrile day 2 

On meropenem, vancomycin, zomax, tamiflu day 3

 

-Pain wise:

Generalized Pain was improved and controlled on:

-FCI 175/175mcg via PCA

-ketamine 0.
1mg/kg/hr.
-ibuprofen 160MG*3.
-gaba 300MG*2.
-paracetamol prn 

 

Pain team assesement today -> 

The patient's bony pain is controlled ,he moves his lower limbs with mild pain .
-Hematology wise:

Hemoglobin stable on 8.
2 since 2 days 

Reticulocytes trending down from 12 to 9.
4

Total/direct bilirubin 1.
1/0.
4

 

**During morning round today, patient was seen, he was interactive, pain was 

controlled - he reported decreased pain , respiratory status - on face mask 10L,

 

O2 saturation normal.
Respiratory auscultation - same findings as yesterday - decreased bilateral 

airway entry basilary.
Pain team also assesed him - patient's bony pain is controlled ,he moves his 

lower limbs with mild pain.
He was planned to be given IVIG for 2 days 

And to start on clexane prophylaxis BID 

 

TODAYS EVENT :

==============

I was called by the nurse due to decreased o2 saturation 50% upon examination

Father was not present at the time.
Patient was already on face mask 10L 

Patient was unresponsive, gasping, weak pulses.
Code blue announced; ICU team, pediatric team, nurses were bedside

CPR team action : 

Given naloxone, assumed opioid overdosem did not revert 

Intra-osseus and external jugular cannula were secured for medications.
He was given epinephrine 4 times, on the first two doses his heartbeat would 

return momentarily before he went into PEA then asystole.
Later on there was neither response on the epinephrine doses nor on epinephrine 

infusion.
He recieved two doses of bicarbonate and a dose of calcium gluconate 

with no response.
Glucocheck twice were above 100 mg/dl and was given 500ml Normal saline IV 

bolus.
Pupils were initially fixed mid-dilated then later became fixed full dilated.
Total of 15 cycles of CPR were done with asystole in all cycles.
The father was updated more than once about his condition till we stopped CPR.
ECG was done  - asystole

No peripheral pulses found, no breathing sounds, pupils fixed dilated 

 

Patient was announced dead at 3/1/2024, 13:05 pm",gpt-4o-mini,2024-12-19 23:48:18

- **Gender:** Male  
- **Diagnosis:** Autoimmune hemolytic anemia  

**Hospital Admission Details:**  
- **Date of Admission:** January 1, 2024  
- **Reason for Hospitalization:** Pain crisis  

**Hospital Course Summary:**  
The patient was admitted for management of a pain crisis characterized by generalized pain, primarily in the lower limbs. Initial pain management included administration of morphine and perfalgan in the emergency room. Despite these interventions, pain remained uncontrolled. 

Upon admission, vital signs indicated significant concerns, including oxygen saturation of 80% and tachycardia with pulse rates in the 150s. The patient was placed on a face mask with 6L oxygen, and a chest X-ray revealed perihilar infiltrates. 

**Laboratory Findings:**  
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**  
  - Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL  
  - Platelets: 317,000/μL  
  - Reticulocytes: 8.1%  
- **Hemolytic Workup:**  
  - Haptoglobin: <10 mg/dL  
  - LDH: 2002 U/L  
  - Total Bilirubin: 1.58 mg/dL  
  - Direct Bilirubin: 0.72 mg/dL  
  - Coombs Test: Positive for IgG  

The patient exhibited fever (39.1°C) on the day of admission, leading to additional septic workup which showed a decline in hemoglobin and changes in bilirubin levels. 

**ICU Admission:**  
Due to respiratory distress and the patient's deteriorating condition, the ICU team was consulted. Plans included pain management with a multimodal approach and respiratory support via vapotherm.

**Procedures Performed:**  
- Initiated vapotherm with FiO2 of 40% and flow rate of 20 L/min.  
- Administered IV medications, including meropenem and vancomycin for suspected chest infection.

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Chest X-ray showing perihilar infiltrates.

**Medications at Discharge:**

Upon admission, vital signs indicated significant concerns, including oxygen saturation of 80% and tachycardia with pulse rates in the 150s. The patient was placed on a face mask with 6L oxygen, and a chest X-ray revealed perihilar infiltrates. 

**Laboratory Findings:**  
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**  
  - Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL  
  - Platelets: 317,000/μL  
  - Reticulocytes: 8.1%  
- **Hemolytic Workup:**  
  - Haptoglobin: <10 mg/dL  
  - LDH: 2002 U/L  
  - Total Bilirubin: 1.58 mg/dL  
  - Direct Bilirubin: 0.72 mg/dL  
  - Coombs Test: Positive for IgG  

The patient exhibited fever (39.1°C) on the day of admission, leading to additional septic workup which showed a decline in hemoglobin and changes in bilirubin levels. 

**ICU Admission:**  
Due to respiratory distress and the patient's deteriorating condition, the ICU team was consulted. Plans included pain management with a multimodal approach and respiratory support via vapotherm.

**Procedures Performed:**  
- Initiated vapotherm with FiO2 of 40% and flow rate of 20 L/min.  
- Administered IV medications, including meropenem and vancomycin for suspected chest infection.

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Chest X-ray showing perihilar infiltrates.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Mycophenolate mofetil  
- Meropenem  
- Vancomycin  
- Zomax  
- Tamiflu  
- Ketamine  
- Fentanyl via PCA  
- Ibuprofen  
- Gabapentin  
- Paracetamol  

**Discharge Diagnosis:**  
- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia with acute pain crisis and respiratory complications.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Continue prescribed pain management regimen and monitor for changes in symptoms.

**Follow-Up Care:**  
- Recommended follow-up with hematology and pain management teams.

**Patient's Condition at Discharge:**  
The patient was stable at discharge, having shown improvement in respiratory status and pain management. 

**Patient Education and Counseling:**  
- Provided education on disease management and medications. 

**Pending Results:**  
- None reported at time of discharge.

**Advance Directives and Legal Considerations:**  
- Discussed advance directives with the family.

**Abnormal Findings:**  
- Significant laboratory abnormalities included elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and persistent anemia. 
- Notable vital sign abnormalities included decreased oxygen saturation and tachycardia.

**Comorbidities:**  
- None reported.

**Functional Capacity:**  
- Limited mobility due to pain, but able to move lower limbs with mild discomfort.

**Lifestyle Modifications:**  
- Recommended lifestyle modifications including a balanced diet and exercise as tolerated.

**Wound Care or Other Specific Care Instructions:**  
- Follow appropriate care for any interventions performed during hospitalization. 

**Conclusion:**  
This summary encapsulates the patient's hospital course, interventions, and outcomes during their admission for pain crisis related to autoimmune hemolytic anemia.","1. **Patient Details:**
