- Left breast cancer classified as cT1N0.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated invasive breast carcinoma, no special type (IBC NST) grade II, with estrogen receptor positivity (90%), progesterone receptor positivity (70%), and HER-2/neu negative by FISH; Ki67 was noted to be 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed metastatic involvement.

**Imaging Results:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound identified an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areola complex.  
- A mass in the right breast was noted, along with a solitary left axillary lymph node with cortical prominence.  
- CT scan showed nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, a bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst requiring follow-up, and no definitive evidence of distant metastasis.  
- Bone scan results were negative.

**Multidisciplinary Discussion:**  
The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference where it was decided to proceed with upfront surgical intervention, given the patient's age and potential for oncotype diagnostic testing post-operatively.

**Clinical Overview:**  
The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a history of hypertension and ischemic heart disease, who is a non-smoker and postmenopausal. She was admitted for elective surgery related to her breast cancer diagnosis.

**Medication History:**  
The patient was on Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide (Concor PLUS) 5/12.5 mg daily.

**Genetic Testing:**  
Results were negative.

**Pathology Findings:**  
- Left breast cancer classified as cT1N0.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated invasive breast carcinoma, no special type (IBC NST) grade II, with estrogen receptor positivity (90%), progesterone receptor positivity (70%), and HER-2/neu negative by FISH; Ki67 was noted to be 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed metastatic involvement.

**Imaging Results:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound identified an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areola complex.  
- A mass in the right breast was noted, along with a solitary left axillary lymph node with cortical prominence.  
- CT scan showed nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, a bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst requiring follow-up, and no definitive evidence of distant metastasis.  
- Bone scan results were negative.

**Multidisciplinary Discussion:**  
The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference where it was decided to proceed with upfront surgical intervention, given the patient's age and potential for oncotype diagnostic testing post-operatively.

**Clinical Overview:**  
The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a history of hypertension and ischemic heart disease, who is a non-smoker and postmenopausal. She was admitted for elective surgery related to her breast cancer diagnosis.

**Medication History:**  
The patient was on Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide (Concor PLUS) 5/12.5 mg daily.

**Pathology Findings:**  
- Left breast cancer classified as cT1N0.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated invasive breast carcinoma, no special type (IBC NST) grade II, with estrogen receptor positivity (90%), progesterone receptor positivity (70%), and HER-2/neu negative by FISH; Ki67 was noted to be 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed metastatic involvement.

**Imaging Results:**  
- A mass in the right breast was noted, along with a solitary left axillary lymph node with cortical prominence.  
- Bone scan results were negative.

**Multidisciplinary Discussion:**  
The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference where it was decided to proceed with upfront surgical intervention, given the patient's age and potential for oncotype diagnostic testing post-operatively.

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left breast cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery  

---

**Clinical Overview:**  
The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a history of hypertension and ischemic heart disease, who is a non-smoker and postmenopausal. She was admitted for elective surgery related to her breast cancer diagnosis.

**Medication History:**  
The patient was on Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide (Concor PLUS) 5/12.5 mg daily.

**Genetic Testing:**  
Results were negative.

**Pathology Findings:**  
- Left breast cancer classified as cT1N0.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated invasive breast carcinoma, no special type (IBC NST) grade II, with estrogen receptor positivity (90%), progesterone receptor positivity (70%), and HER-2/neu negative by FISH; Ki67 was noted to be 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed metastatic involvement.

**Imaging Results:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound identified an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areola complex.  
- A mass in the right breast was noted, along with a solitary left axillary lymph node with cortical prominence.  
- CT scan showed nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, a bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst requiring follow-up, and no definitive evidence of distant metastasis.  
- Bone scan results were negative.

**Multidisciplinary Discussion:**  
The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary conference where it was decided to proceed with upfront surgical intervention, given the patient's age and potential for oncotype diagnostic testing post-operatively.

---

**Physical Exam:**  
Upon examination, a mass was noted in the left breast at the 12 o'clock position, measuring approximately 1.8 x 1.5 cm and located close to the skin.

---

**Procedures Performed During Hospitalization:**  
- Left wide local excision (WLE) with axillary dissection.

---

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient is stable and has shown good progress. Pain management is adequate. A drain was placed with 60 cc serosanguineous output, and the surgical site is covered with a clean dressing.

---

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Left breast cancer  
**Discharge Date:** July 1, 2024

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left breast cancer with positive margin  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  

The patient is a [REDACTED]-year-old female with a past medical history notable for hypertension and hypothyroidism.

No reportable genetic variants were identified.

**Mammogram Findings:**   
- January 2023: BIRADS 2  
- March 2024: Irregular heterogeneous hypoechoic mass in the lower inner left breast, measuring approximately 1.4 x 0.8 x 1.6 cm, and a second spiculated mass in the periareolar region measuring about 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm, both suspicious for malignancy. Additional findings included an irregular hypoechoic mass/lymph node in the left axilla.

**Histopathology:**  
- Invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, grade 2, with positive axillary nodes.  
- Pathologic stage: pT1cN1a.  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- CAP CT revealed two mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla.  
- Bone scan was unremarkable.

---

**Procedure Performed:**  
- Status post wide local excision and bracketing breast reduction mammoplasty with axillary dissection.

**Pathology Results:**  
- Left breast wide local excision revealed bifocal invasive breast carcinoma, intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ, with involvement of the superior margin.  
- Two out of fifteen left axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma.  
- Margins from the upper outer mass excision showed usual ductal hyperplasia and a fibroadenoma.

---

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient was admitted for a left breast wider excision. She was assessed on the day of discharge and was reported to be stable, with no pain, nausea, or vomiting, and tolerated oral intake well. The breast wound was appropriately dressed, with no swelling noted, and a drain was placed with minimal output.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left breast cancer with positive margin  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  

The patient is a [REDACTED]-year-old female with a past medical history notable for hypertension and hypothyroidism.

**Mammogram Findings:**   
- January 2023: BIRADS 2  
- March 2024: Irregular heterogeneous hypoechoic mass in the lower inner left breast, measuring approximately 1.4 x 0.8 x 1.6 cm, and a second spiculated mass in the periareolar region measuring about 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm, both suspicious for malignancy. Additional findings included an irregular hypoechoic mass/lymph node in the left axilla.

**Histopathology:**  
- Invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, grade 2, with positive axillary nodes.  
- Pathologic stage: pT1cN1a.  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- CAP CT revealed two mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla.  

---

**Procedure Performed:**  
- Status post wide local excision and bracketing breast reduction mammoplasty with axillary dissection.

**Pathology Results:**  
- Left breast wide local excision revealed bifocal invasive breast carcinoma, intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ, with involvement of the superior margin.  
- Two out of fifteen left axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma.  
- Margins from the upper outer mass excision showed usual ductal hyperplasia and a fibroadenoma.

---

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient was admitted for a left breast wider excision. She was assessed on the day of discharge and was reported to be stable, with no pain, nausea, or vomiting, and tolerated oral intake well. The breast wound was appropriately dressed, with no swelling noted, and a drain was placed with minimal output.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  

The patient is a [REDACTED]-year-old female with a past medical history notable for hypertension and hypothyroidism.

No reportable genetic variants were identified.

**Mammogram Findings:**   
- January 2023: BIRADS 2  
- March 2024: Irregular heterogeneous hypoechoic mass in the lower inner left breast, measuring approximately 1.4 x 0.8 x 1.6 cm, and a second spiculated mass in the periareolar region measuring about 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm, both suspicious for malignancy. Additional findings included an irregular hypoechoic mass/lymph node in the left axilla.

**Histopathology:**  
- Invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, grade 2, with positive axillary nodes.  
- Pathologic stage: pT1cN1a.  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- CAP CT revealed two mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla.  
- Bone scan was unremarkable.

---

**Procedure Performed:**  
- Status post wide local excision and bracketing breast reduction mammoplasty with axillary dissection.

**Pathology Results:**  
- Left breast wide local excision revealed bifocal invasive breast carcinoma, intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ, with involvement of the superior margin.  
- Two out of fifteen left axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma.  
- Margins from the upper outer mass excision showed usual ductal hyperplasia and a fibroadenoma.

**Significant Findings from History and Exam:**  

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old married female, Para [Redacted], with a history of all vaginal deliveries. Last menstrual period was on May 21, 2024.  

**Surgical History:**  
- Two excisions of lipomas in the head and neck area  
- D&C for miscarriage  

**Family History:**  
- Mother with a history of skin cancer  

The patient has reported back pain since February 2024 and sought evaluation from her gynecologist, which led to the discovery of an ovarian cyst. Surgical intervention was initially planned but was delayed. A second opinion from Dr. [Redacted] prompted a CT scan, revealing a complex cystic mass in the left ovary.  

**Physical Exam:**  
- Abdomen soft and lax  
- Ultrasound indicated a complex left ovarian mass  

**Imaging Findings:**  

- **Pelvic MRI (May 13, 2024):**  
  - A 13 x 10 x 12 cm cystic mass in the lower abdomen/pelvis likely arising from the left ovary, containing hemorrhagic and proteinaceous fluid with papillary projections. The mass is in proximity to the bladder dome and the right ovary. No pelvic lymphadenopathy noted.  

- **CT Scan of Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis:**  
  - A 12.5 x 10 cm cystic lesion likely from the left ovary, compressing the urinary bladder, with no signs of ascites or significant lymphadenopathy. A hypoattenuating lesion in the liver measuring 1.3 cm was noted for follow-up.  

- **PET Scan:**  
  - No definitive distant metastasis; findings of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are suggestive of inflammatory processes.  

**Plan:**  
- Scheduled for midline laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), omentectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection.  
- Risks discussed with the patient include intraoperative bleeding, potential need for blood transfusion, injury to abdominal organs, the possibility of reoperation, wound complications, and thromboembolic events.  

The patient consented to proceed with surgery on July 11, 2024.

### Active Issues:

1. **Acute Renal Shutdown**  
   - The patient is noted to be anuric.  
   - Renal ultrasound findings were unremarkable.  
   - IV fluids were initiated at 100 mL/hour.  
   - **Plan:** Decrease fluid administration to 40 mL/hour.  

2. **Agitation**  
   - The patient demonstrated signs of hyperactive delirium secondary to renal shutdown.  
   - She was not adequately controlled on haloperidol, but her agitation was managed with:  
     - Chlorpromazine 12.5 mg TID  
     - Chlorpromazine 25 mg every 6 hours as needed  
     - Midazolam 2 mg as needed every 4 hours as a second-line agent  

3. **Pain Management**  
   - The patient has a history of chronic pain characterized by heaviness, numbness, and throbbing, with exacerbation related to movement and eating.  
   - She also reported polyarthralgia and rib pain, likely related to rib fractures, as well as RUQ abdominal pain potentially associated with gallbladder stones.  
   - Previous medications included gabapentin, tramadol, and buscopan, which were discontinued due to the patient's unconscious state.  
   - **Current Management:** Fentanyl IV as needed.  

4. **Depression**  
   - The patient was previously on venlafaxine and lorazepam.  
   - **Plan:** Hold all medications due to inability to swallow.  

5. **Respiratory Secretions**  
   - Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg TID was initiated to address respiratory secretions.

**Significant Findings from History and Examination:**  
The patient is a female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017. Treatment included neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by left modified radical mastectomy and axillary dissection on January 10, 2017. Pathology indicated no residual carcinoma with 1 of 9 lymph nodes positive, classified as ypT0N1. The patient subsequently received adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (50Gy/25Fx) to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completed on January 30, 2018, along with adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen.

Recent brain MRI findings revealed two left temporal lesions with characteristics suggestive of CNS lymphoma and/or brain metastases. There was interval enlargement of adjacent lesions in the posterior left temporal lobe with increased surrounding edema, prompting the need for a biopsy to confirm histopathology.

**Procedures Conducted During Hospitalization:**  
- Navigation Guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Clinical Developments During Hospitalization:**  
The patient was evaluated by the neurosurgery team and was noted to be well, conscious, alert, and oriented. She exhibited no signs of respiratory distress and tolerated her diet. Chest physiotherapy was performed, and ambulation was encouraged. A new dressing was applied with no signs of erythema and minimal discharge from the surgical site.

Consultation with Dr. Ibrahim Arrad was conducted regarding the patient’s elevated blood pressure readings. The management plan included the initiation of Amlodipine 5 mg BID and Candesartan 16 mg BID.

**Examination Findings:**
- **General:** No pallor, jaundice, or cervical lymphadenopathy
- **Respiratory:** Clear bilateral breath sounds
- **Cardiovascular:** Normal heart sounds without rubs, murmurs, or gallops. No jugular venous distention or lower limb edema.
- **Abdomen:** Soft and non-tender, without rigidity or rebound tenderness.
- **Neurological:** Fully conscious, alert, and oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15. All limbs moved freely and interaction was appropriate.

      There are two left temporal lesions, their close proximity 

to the CSF and 

associated diffusion

      restriction and minimal surrounding vasogenic oedema raise 

the possibility 

of CNS lymphoma in

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left temporal brain metastases vs. lymphoma  
**Admission Date:** June 25, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery - Navigation Guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Significant Findings from History and Examination:**  
The patient is a female with a history of left breast cancer diagnosed in April 2017. Treatment included neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC x4 + Taxotere/Herceptin x4), followed by left modified radical mastectomy and axillary dissection on January 10, 2017. Pathology indicated no residual carcinoma with 1 of 9 lymph nodes positive, classified as ypT0N1. The patient subsequently received adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (50Gy/25Fx) to the left chest wall and supraclavicular fossa, completed on January 30, 2018, along with adjuvant Herceptin and Tamoxifen.

Recent brain MRI findings revealed two left temporal lesions with characteristics suggestive of CNS lymphoma and/or brain metastases. There was interval enlargement of adjacent lesions in the posterior left temporal lobe with increased surrounding edema, prompting the need for a biopsy to confirm histopathology.

**Procedures Conducted During Hospitalization:**  
- Navigation Guided left temporal craniotomy and tumor biopsy  

---

**Clinical Developments During Hospitalization:**  
The patient was evaluated by the neurosurgery team and was noted to be well, conscious, alert, and oriented. She exhibited no signs of respiratory distress and tolerated her diet. Chest physiotherapy was performed, and ambulation was encouraged. A new dressing was applied with no signs of erythema and minimal discharge from the surgical site.

Consultation with Dr. Ibrahim Arrad was conducted regarding the patient’s elevated blood pressure readings. The management plan included the initiation of Amlodipine 5 mg BID and Candesartan 16 mg BID.

**Examination Findings:**
- **General:** No pallor, jaundice, or cervical lymphadenopathy
- **Respiratory:** Clear bilateral breath sounds
- **Cardiovascular:** Normal heart sounds without rubs, murmurs, or gallops. No jugular venous distention or lower limb edema.
- **Abdomen:** Soft and non-tender, without rigidity or rebound tenderness.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient is a [Confidential]-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 and has no known drug allergies.

The patient has a history of sigmoid colon cancer with metachronous colorectal liver metastases, status post urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022. The pathological staging is noted as pT3N2bMx. The surgical course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and the development of a colcutaneous fistula, leading to a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. The multidisciplinary cancer team determined that there was no role for adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window. 

The patient underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) targeting the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60Gy delivered in five fractions.

The patient presented on June 27, 2024, with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation, fecalization, and air-fluid levels, with the maximum diameter measuring 4.5 cm, as well as mild bowel wall thickening and peritoneal fat stranding, but no evidence of pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including NPO status and intravenous fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast showed an increase in small bowel diameter (approximately 5.5 cm) and a persistent transitional point at the level of the parastomal hernia. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, separate from the transition point.

**Plan:**  
Following a discussion with Dr. Bilal [Confidential], it was determined that given the increasing small bowel diameter and tachycardia, an urgent surgical repair of the parastomal hernia is warranted. The patient was informed of the potential risks and complications associated with surgery, including leakage, bleeding, hematoma, recurrence, and other postoperative risks.

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient is a [Confidential]-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 and has no known drug allergies. An allergy to penicillin was noted during admission.

The patient has a history of sigmoid colon cancer with metachronous colorectal liver metastases, status post urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022. The pathological staging is noted as pT3N2bMx. The surgical course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and the development of a colcutaneous fistula, leading to a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient is a [Confidential]-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 and has no known drug allergies.

The patient has a history of sigmoid colon cancer with metachronous colorectal liver metastases, status post urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022. The pathological staging is noted as pT3N2bMx. The surgical course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and the development of a colcutaneous fistula, leading to a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. The multidisciplinary cancer team determined that there was no role for adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window. 

The patient underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) targeting the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60Gy delivered in five fractions.

The patient presented on June 27, 2024, with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation, fecalization, and air-fluid levels, with the maximum diameter measuring 4.5 cm, as well as mild bowel wall thickening and peritoneal fat stranding, but no evidence of pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including NPO status and intravenous fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast showed an increase in small bowel diameter (approximately 5.5 cm) and a persistent transitional point at the level of the parastomal hernia. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, separate from the transition point.

**Plan:**  
Following a discussion with Dr. Bilal [Confidential], it was determined that given the increasing small bowel diameter and tachycardia, an urgent surgical repair of the parastomal hernia is warranted. The patient was informed of the potential risks and complications associated with surgery, including leakage, bleeding, hematoma, recurrence, and other postoperative risks.

Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, separate from the transition point.

**Plan:**  
Following a discussion with Dr. Bilal [Confidential], it was determined that given the increasing small bowel diameter and tachycardia, an urgent surgical repair of the parastomal hernia is warranted. The patient was informed of the potential risks and complications associated with surgery, including leakage, bleeding, hematoma, recurrence, and other postoperative risks.

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 and has no known drug allergies.

The patient has a history of sigmoid colon cancer with metachronous colorectal liver metastases, status post urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022. The surgical course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and the development of a colcutaneous fistula, leading to a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. 

The patient underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) targeting the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60Gy delivered in five fractions.

The patient presented on June 27, 2024, with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation, fecalization, and air-fluid levels, with the maximum diameter measuring 4.5 cm, as well as mild bowel wall thickening and peritoneal fat stranding, but no evidence of pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including NPO status and intravenous fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast showed an increase in small bowel diameter (approximately 5.5 cm) and a persistent transitional point at the level of the parastomal hernia. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, separate from the transition point.

**Admission Diagnosis:** Intestinal obstruction  
**Admission Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Abdominal Pain  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 and has no known drug allergies.

The patient has a history of sigmoid colon cancer with metachronous colorectal liver metastases, status post urgent sigmoidectomy on July 4, 2022. The pathological staging is noted as pT3N2bMx. The surgical course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and the development of a colcutaneous fistula, leading to a diverting transverse colostomy on June 16, 2022. The multidisciplinary cancer team determined that there was no role for adjuvant chemotherapy due to exceeding the treatment window. 

The patient underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) targeting the liver, completed on June 27, 2023, with a total dose of 60Gy delivered in five fractions.

The patient presented on June 27, 2024, with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased output from the stoma, with the last bowel movement noted one day prior. 

A CT scan of the abdomen revealed small bowel dilation, fecalization, and air-fluid levels, with the maximum diameter measuring 4.5 cm, as well as mild bowel wall thickening and peritoneal fat stranding, but no evidence of pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.

The patient was admitted for conservative management, including NPO status and intravenous fluids. A follow-up CT with oral contrast showed an increase in small bowel diameter (approximately 5.5 cm) and a persistent transitional point at the level of the parastomal hernia. Additionally, a new terminal ileal mass with suspicious characteristics was identified, separate from the transition point.

**Plan:**  
Following a discussion with Dr. Bilal [Confidential], it was determined that given the increasing small bowel diameter and tachycardia, an urgent surgical repair of the parastomal hernia is warranted. The patient was informed of the potential risks and complications associated with surgery, including leakage, bleeding, hematoma, recurrence, and other postoperative risks.

- Laparotomy for exploration
