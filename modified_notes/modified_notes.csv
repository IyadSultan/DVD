---

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.  

**Findings:**  
- Left Breast Cancer classified as cT1N0 based on imaging and biopsy results.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated Invasive Breast Carcinoma, No Special Type (IBC NST) with ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, and Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic disease.  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, situated 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex. The right breast exhibited a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm and additional oval masses consistent with cysts.  
- CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which requires follow-up. A bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst was also observed, warranting further evaluation. No evidence of distant metastasis was detected on the bone scan.  

The case was reviewed during the multidisciplinary conference, and the decision was made to proceed with upfront surgery, considering the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Code Status:** Full Code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left Breast Cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective Surgery  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. Patient has a history of diabetes, currently well-controlled with metformin. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.  

**Findings:**  
- Left Breast Cancer classified as cT1N0 based on imaging and biopsy results.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated Invasive Breast Carcinoma, No Special Type (IBC NST) with ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, and Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic disease.  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, situated 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex. The right breast exhibited a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm and additional oval masses consistent with cysts.  
- CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which requires follow-up. A bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst was also observed, warranting further evaluation. No evidence of distant metastasis was detected on the bone scan.  

The case was reviewed during the multidisciplinary conference, and the decision was made to proceed with upfront surgery, considering the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.  

**Physical Examination:**  
Notable findings included a mass in the left breast located at the 12 o'clock position measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm, in close proximity to the skin.

**Code Status:** Full Code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left Breast Cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective Surgery  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.  

**Findings:**  
- Left Breast Cancer classified as cT1N0 based on imaging and biopsy results.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated Invasive Breast Carcinoma, No Special Type (IBC NST) with ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, and Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic disease.  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, situated 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex. The right breast exhibited a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm and additional oval masses consistent with cysts.  
- CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which requires follow-up. A bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst was also observed, warranting further evaluation. No evidence of distant metastasis was detected on the bone scan.  

The case was reviewed during the multidisciplinary conference, and the decision was made to proceed with upfront surgery, considering the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.  

**Physical Examination:**  
Notable findings included a mass in the left breast located at the 12 o'clock position measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm, in close proximity to the skin.

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.  

**Findings:**  
- Left Breast Cancer classified as cT1N0 based on imaging and biopsy results.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated Invasive Breast Carcinoma, No Special Type (IBC NST) with ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, and Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic disease.  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, situated 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex. The right breast exhibited a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm and additional oval masses consistent with cysts.  
- CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which requires follow-up. A bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst was also observed, warranting further evaluation. No evidence of distant metastasis was detected on the bone scan.  

The case was reviewed during the multidisciplinary conference, and the decision was made to proceed with upfront surgery, considering the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.  

**Physical Examination:**  
Notable findings included a mass in the left breast located at the 12 o'clock position measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm, in close proximity to the skin.

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.  

**Findings:**  
- Left Breast Cancer classified as cT1N0 based on imaging and biopsy results.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated Invasive Breast Carcinoma, No Special Type (IBC NST) with ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, and Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic disease.  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, situated 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex. The right breast exhibited a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm and additional oval masses consistent with cysts.  
- CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which requires follow-up. A bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst was also observed, warranting further evaluation. No evidence of distant metastasis was detected on the bone scan.  

The case was reviewed during the multidisciplinary conference, and the decision was made to proceed with upfront surgery, considering the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left Breast Cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  

The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, currently managed with Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide. She is a non-smoker and post-menopausal.  

**Findings:**  
- Left Breast Cancer classified as cT1N0 based on imaging and biopsy results.  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated Invasive Breast Carcinoma, No Special Type (IBC NST) with ER 90%, PR 70%, HER-2/neu negative by FISH, and Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic disease.  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, situated 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex. The right breast exhibited a mass of 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm and additional oval masses consistent with cysts.  
- CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which requires follow-up. A bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst was also observed, warranting further evaluation. No evidence of distant metastasis was detected on the bone scan.  

The case was reviewed during the multidisciplinary conference, and the decision was made to proceed with upfront surgery, considering the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.  

**Physical Examination:**  
Notable findings included a mass in the left breast located at the 12 o'clock position measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm, in close proximity to the skin.  

---

**Procedures Performed:**  
- Left Total Wide Local Excision with Axillary Dissection  

---

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient is stable and has been managing pain effectively. A drain is in place with serosanguinous output, and the surgical site is covered with a clean dressing.
