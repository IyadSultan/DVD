Findings: Within the limitation 

of CT scan, there is no significant interval change regarding the size of the 

of 

the known supra and infratentorial metastatic lesions, 

however, the perilesional vasogenic oedema appear increased. No midline shift 

or 

life-threatening herniation. Grossly unchanged 

calcified meningioma based along the clivus, encasing the basilar artery as 

before and indenting the anterior aspect of the 

craniocervical junction. The brain vasculature appears patent without gross 

filling defect to suggest thrombosis. No acute intracranial 

haemorrhage or established major territorial infarction. Diffuse parenchymal 

atrophic changes with dilated ventricular system and other 

CSF spaces as before. No active hydrocephalus. Resolved previously seen 

mucosal 

thickening of sphenoid sinus and right posterior 

ethmoid air cells. The rest of paranasal sinuses appear clear. Partially 

opacified mastoid air cells bilaterally as before. No orbital 

pathology could be detected. No grossly destructive osseous lesion.

He presented to the ER with generalized pain - mostly lower limbs (pain crisis) 

He was already on:

MIR 10mg, MST 60mg,  fentaNYL PATCH  25 mcg/hr at home

 

In the ER, he was given perfelgan, and morphine 5mg IV twice 

Pain was still not controlled. 

 

Vitals taken in the ER showed decrease O2 saturation 80%, pulse reaching 150's

He was put on face mask 6L, chest x ray was requested - showed perihilar 

infiltrates. 

 

Labs on admission showed: 

CBC - hemoglobin 10.8, platelets 317, reticulocytes 8.1%

Hemolytic workeup done - haptoglobin <10, LDH 2002, total bilirubin/direct 

bilirubin = 1.58/0.72, coombs test ( direct and indirect ) positive, 

monospecific coombs test +4 IgG.

 

Admitted for pain management.

 

He spiked a fever on the same day of admission 39.1 c 

Septic workeup was done and repeated

CBC - hemoglobin 9.8, reticulocytes 9%, total bilirubin/direct bilirubin 

1.54/0.54

He stayed tachypnic ( while on face mask 6L, so he was put on vapotherm, on 

auscultation he had decreased basilar bilateral airway entry )

 

ICU were consulted:

Dr.**********n was informed about his condition 

Plan: - Manage pain 

      - Start supportive vapotherm --> he was started on vapotherm FiO2 40, Flow

 

        rate 20 

 

Dr.**********an **********taab was informed about his generalized pain condition 

pain team plan : - start ketamine 0.1mg/kg/hr

                 - increase fentanyl by PCA to 175/175 - gradually increased

                 - make paracetramol regualar 

                 - give hydrocortison stress dose 

                 - re-assess after changes & inform dr.**********an 

 

He was started on meropenem, vancomycin, zomax, tamiflu as a case of chest 

infection

 

-Respiratory:

Patient was on vapotherm FiO2 40, Flow rate 20 on 1/1

Today, on 3/1, his respiratory status was improved, so he was weaned to face 

mask 10L after assesement by the respiratory team , his o2 saturation on face 

mask 10L was 99%

 

-Infectious wise:

Today, he was afebrile day 2 

On meropenem, vancomycin, zomax, tamiflu day 3

 

-Pain wise:

Generalized Pain was improved and controlled on:

-FCI 175/175mcg via PCA

-ketamine 0.1mg/kg/hr.

-ibuprofen 160MG*3.

-gaba 300MG*2.

-paracetamol prn 

 

Pain team assesement today -> 

The patient's bony pain is controlled ,he moves his lower limbs with mild pain .

 

-Hematology wise:

Hemoglobin stable on 8.2 since 2 days 

Reticulocytes trending down from 12 to 9.4

Total/direct bilirubin 1.1/0.4

 

**During morning round today, patient was seen, he was interactive, pain was 

controlled - he reported decreased pain , respiratory status - on face mask 10L,

 

O2 saturation normal.

Respiratory auscultation - same findings as yesterday - decreased bilateral 

airway entry basilary. 

Pain team also assesed him - patient's bony pain is controlled ,he moves his 

lower limbs with mild pain. 

 

He was planned to be given IVIG for 2 days 

And to start on clexane prophylaxis BID 

 

TODAYS EVENT :

==============

I was called by the nurse due to decreased o2 saturation 50% upon examination

Father was not present at the time. 

Patient was already on face mask 10L 

Patient was unresponsive, gasping, weak pulses. 

 

Code blue announced; ICU team, pediatric team, nurses were bedside

CPR team action : 

Given naloxone, assumed opioid overdosem did not revert 

Intra-osseus and external jugular cannula were secured for medications.

He was given epinephrine 4 times, on the first two doses his heartbeat would 

return momentarily before he went into PEA then asystole. 

Later on there was neither response on the epinephrine doses nor on epinephrine 

infusion.

He recieved two doses of bicarbonate and a dose of calcium gluconate 

with no response. 

Glucocheck twice were above 100 mg/dl and was given 500ml Normal saline IV 

bolus. 

Pupils were initially fixed mid-dilated then later became fixed full dilated.

 

Total of 15 cycles of CPR were done with asystole in all cycles. 

 

The father was updated more than once about his condition till we stopped CPR. 

 

ECG was done  - asystole

No peripheral pulses found, no breathing sounds, pupils fixed dilated 

 

Patient was announced dead at 3/1/2024, 13:05 pm
