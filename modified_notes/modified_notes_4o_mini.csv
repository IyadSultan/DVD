**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

---

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left Breast Cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, who is a non-smoker and post-menopausal. She is currently on Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide.

**Genetic testing** returned negative.

**Diagnosis:**  
- Left Breast Cancer: cT1N0  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated invasive breast cancer, no special type (NST) II, with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity at 90%, progesterone receptor (PR) positivity at 70%, and HER-2/neu negative by FISH; Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed metastatic involvement.

**Imaging Findings:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex, and a mass in the right breast measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm, with additional cystic structures.  
- A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited a prominent cortex.  
- CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which will require follow-up, and a bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst necessitating gynecological evaluation. There was no definite evidence of distant metastasis noted.  
- Bone scan results were negative.

The case was reviewed at the multidisciplinary conference, and surgery was recommended due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
The patient underwent a left wide local excision (WLE) with axillary dissection.

**In-Hospital Course:**  
The patient is stable with effective pain management. A drain remains in place with serosanguinous output. The surgical site is covered with a clean dressing.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

---

**Code Status:** Full code  
**Admission Diagnosis:** Left Breast Cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024  
**Active Problem:** Elective surgery  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, who is a non-smoker and post-menopausal. She is currently on Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide.

**Genetic testing** returned negative.

**Diagnosis:**  
- Left Breast Cancer: cT1N0  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated invasive breast cancer, no special type (NST) II, with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity at 90%, progesterone receptor (PR) positivity at 70%, and HER-2/neu negative by FISH; Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed metastatic involvement.

**Imaging Findings:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex, and a mass in the right breast measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm, with additional cystic structures.  
- A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited a prominent cortex.  
- CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which will require follow-up, and a bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst necessitating gynecological evaluation. There was no definite evidence of distant metastasis noted.  
- Bone scan results were negative.

The case was reviewed at the multidisciplinary conference, and surgery was recommended due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
The patient underwent a left wide local excision (WLE) with axillary dissection.

**In-Hospital Course:**  
The patient is stable with effective pain management. A drain remains in place with serosanguinous output. The surgical site is covered with a clean dressing. The patient's vital signs during hospitalization were stable, with the exception of a transient low-grade fever of 37.8°C on post-operative day one.

- Left Breast Cancer: cT1N0  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated invasive breast cancer, no special type (NST) II, with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity at 90%, progesterone receptor (PR) positivity at 70%, and HER-2/neu negative by FISH; Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed metastatic involvement.

**Imaging Findings:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex, and a mass in the right breast measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm, with additional cystic structures.  
- A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited a prominent cortex.  
- CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which will require follow-up, and a bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst necessitating gynecological evaluation. There was no definite evidence of distant metastasis noted.  
- Bone scan results were negative.

The case was reviewed at the multidisciplinary conference, and surgery was recommended due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
The patient underwent a left wide local excision (WLE) with axillary dissection.

**In-Hospital Course:**  
The patient is stable with effective pain management. A drain remains in place with serosanguinous output. The surgical site is covered with a clean dressing.

**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**  

---

**Admission Diagnosis:** Left Breast Cancer  
**Admission Date:** June 29, 2024**  

---

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension and ischemic heart disease, who is a non-smoker and post-menopausal. She is currently on Bisoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide.

**Genetic testing** returned negative.

**Diagnosis:**  
- Left Breast Cancer: cT1N0  
- Right breast biopsy revealed benign breast tissue.  
- Left breast biopsy indicated invasive breast cancer, no special type (NST) II, with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity at 90%, progesterone receptor (PR) positivity at 70%, and HER-2/neu negative by FISH; Ki67 at 5%.  
- Left axillary biopsy confirmed metastatic involvement.

**Imaging Findings:**  
- Mammogram and breast ultrasound showed an irregular mass in the left breast measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, located 5.5 cm from the nipple-areolar complex, and a mass in the right breast measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 1.5 cm, with additional cystic structures.  
- A solitary left axillary lymph node exhibited a prominent cortex.  
- CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, which will require follow-up, and a bulky uterus with a large left ovarian cyst necessitating gynecological evaluation. There was no definite evidence of distant metastasis noted.  
- Bone scan results were negative.

The case was reviewed at the multidisciplinary conference, and surgery was recommended due to the patient's age and the potential for oncotype DX testing post-operatively.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
The patient underwent a left wide local excision (WLE) with axillary dissection.

**In-Hospital Course:**  
The patient is stable with effective pain management. A drain remains in place with serosanguinous output. The surgical site is covered with a clean dressing.

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Left Breast Cancer  
**Discharge Date:** July 1, 2024  
**Discharge Type:** Elective Discharge

**Medications upon Discharge:** No outpatient medications were identified for the patient at this time.

**Pending Test Results:** Histopathology  

---

**Patient Condition upon Discharge:**  
- Glasgow Coma Scale: 15  
- Performance Status: 0 (Fully Active)  
- Pain Scale: 1

**Follow-Up Plan:**  
- Follow-up appointment with Surgical Oncology: Dr. [Redacted] on July 10, 2024.  

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Diet: Regular  
- When to seek urgent care: Shortness of breath, altered level of consciousness, uncontrolled pain, fever above 38.0°C, uncontrolled side effects from chemotherapy/radiotherapy (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), or any postoperative complications (e.g., discharge from the surgical site).
